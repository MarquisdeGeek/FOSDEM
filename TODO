Data that is missing
====================

* Durations of talks
* Speakers and topics for early devroom talks
* Early devrooms had no schedule on the FOSDEM site
* Lightning talks from 2005 were unofficial. Are they recorded anywhere? Should they be added?


Information that might be wrong
===============================

* Unified naming for the devrooms (see devrooms.js)
* Speaker names (e.g. Steve and Steven will not be aggregated)


Open questions
==============

* Do opening/closing talks count?
* Do "Welcome to the devroom" count?
* Do LPI exams count?

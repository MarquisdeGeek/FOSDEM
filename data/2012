        <abstract>This talk will discuss our experience at [AdaCore](http://www.adacore.com/), one of only a handful of 100% Free Software companies. All of our commercial products are licensed under the GPL and other Free Software Licenses.
People often assume that there is a conflict between the use of such licenses and the needs of a commercial software company. Our experience at AdaCore shows that on the contrary, the Free Software model can be very successful both for us as a company and for our customers.
We think this model can be used in many other circumstances, and want to encourage free software enthusiasts to consider this model in other circumstances.</abstract>

        <abstract>We believe system (and distribution) development needs to be
re-thought from the basic concepts upwards. We've implemented some
ideas for streamlining development, reducing development friction,
speeding up system upgrades and adding support for downgrades and
rollbacks, and generally making development of entire systems faster
and more fun.

At the level of individual, atomic projects, several great tools and
development methods have been developed over the past decade or so.
Few of them are applied at the system or distribution level. The Linux
kernel development, for example, greatly benefits from the ease of
branching and merging that git provides, but it is not possible to branch
and merge the whole system, or distribution, consisting of hundreds
or tens of thousands of individual projects.

From the agile development worlds, automated testing, test driven
development, and continuous integration are common-place for individual
projects, but not so much for complete systems development. Would it not
be nice to have them?

Packages have been the darling child of Linux distribution development
since the early days. They are a natural, modular concept, and have been
one of the key factors behind the success of the distribution concept.
Package managers have made it easy to install and remove and upgrade
each piece of software separately, and to upgrade the whole system by
upgrading each installed package. However, a modern distribution consists
of tens of thousands of packages, and the combinatorial explosion of
dependencies and interaction may be getting out of hand. In this talk
we explore another way of approaching the packaging problem.

We believe these and other changes are useful for bridging the current
gap between upstream development and end users, to speed up system
and distribution development, and to let system builders bravely
hack what no-one has hacked before.

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Ganeti is a sophisticated system (~60,000 lines of python code and ~6,000 lines of haskell code) for managing clusters of virtual machines (based on KVM, Xen or LXC). In this talk we'll describe the internal subsystems and how they interact with the open source virtualization software it manages. Attendees will gain insights on how Ganeti works and how it can be customized to fit their environment.

</abstract>
        <description>This talk will explore:
- Ganeti components and internals: dissecting what happens under the hood.
- Which open source virtualization components Ganeti manages and how
- Scaling limitations and plans for improvements.
- How to modify Ganeti and examples of the most common customizations.
- Future directions and the next year's roadmap.

        <abstract>The KVM hypervisor entered the Linux kernel at the beginning of 2007 and, since then, it has progressed a lot in terms of scalability, performance and features.  Together with it, an entirely open-source stack of user-mode virtualization tools has come into existence and seen vigorous development.  Its components include management tools (libvirt, oVirt), guest rescue and inspection tools (guestfish), desktop virtualization (spice), user interfaces (virt-manager and now Boxes).  The stability of the hypervisor and the fast-paced development of the tools created a virtuous circle that is quickly bridging the gap between proprietary and open-source virtualization.

In this talk, I will highlight the recent additions to KVM and the accompanying tools, and present features that are new or in the works.</abstract>

        <abstract>The talk is about operating system virtualization technology known as OpenVZ. This is an effective way of partitioning a Linux machine into multiple isolated Linux containers. All containers are running on top of one single Linux kernel, which results in excellent density, performance and manageability. 

The talk gives an overall description of OpenVZ building blocks, such as namespaces, cgroups and various resource controllers. A few features, notably live migration and virtual swap, are described in greater details. Results of some performance measurements against VMware, Xen and KVM are given. Finally, we will provide a status update on merging bits and pieces of OpenVZ kernel to upstream Linux kernel, and share our plans for the future.

The talk is suitable for general audience, but will be of most interest to people interested in Linux kernel, resource management, virtualization, and cloud computing.</abstract>

        <abstract>The goal of the Native Linux KVM Tool is to provide a clean, from-scratch, lightweight
KVM host tool implementation that can boot Linux guest images with no 
BIOS dependencies and with only the minimal amount of legacy device
emulation.
</abstract>
        <description>The Native KVM tool was started as a response to Ingo Molnar's proposal
about a userspace tool which would sit under the /tools/ directory in the
kernel tree and be the usermode counterpart of the kernel side KVM
(the mail &amp; related thread can be found at
thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/962051/focus=962620 )

Biggest features of the tool are:
- Zero-config userspace networking for guests that have DHCP enabled
- SMP support
- No external BIOS required
- Experimental GUI support with SDL and VNC
- Host filesystem access via 9P/virtio
- Raw image support
- Host block devices as in-memory copy-on-write guest images on 64-bit hosts
- PPC64 Support
- Experimental QCOW2 image support

The tool was developed over the course of almost two years, and is now
in a stage where it is ready for merging into the kernel tree.</description>

        <type>lecture</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>The last few years has seen many different Mobile Linux projects come and go, both big and small, commercial and open source. This talk seeks to present about the current state of Mobile Linux and future challenges of the platforms that drive our mobile devices. The angle of attack is to identify and explain tendencies in technology about moving beyond Mobile Linux as defined by Linux handsets, netbooks and tablets - towards more unified and more connected experiences of interaction. The talk will center around the problems and challenges that open source efforts will have in such a world of connected experiences and describe what current efforts exist within the open source community that recognise this shift beyond traditional Mobile Linux.
</abstract>
        <description>We are moving towards a paradigm shift in how we use computers - in fact we, we already see the beginnings of this in the way we use our mobile devices today. People are switching away from PCs onto tablets, your phone is more like a computer in your pocket and the monopoly of exclusively using the PC and the traditional WIMP interfaces has been broken.

But the problem is - this brave new world is so detrimentally different from the PC world that we in the Linux-centered open source community has been building software, distributions and UI toolkits for. And now many claim that the PC is dead! So what are we to do now? And what advantages do we have in this new world?

This talk will illustrate what challenges efforts in Mobile Linux face and present areas we as a community need to collaborate together in to be strong in the new world of connected devices. 

Conservative views will be challenged and holy cows of traditional open source will be touched as entirely new approaches to a Linux experience - both in software, distributions and UI toolkits are needed to face these new challenges. Many efforts already exist that are going in the right direction and these will be described and contribution and collaboration and creation of new projects fitting this new world motivated.

        <abstract>## EFL, the toolkit for up and coming mobile devices ##

EFL (The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) were written to support the development of Enlightenment, and ultimately became a complete toolkit for making applications for desktops and especially lower powered devices like phones and tablets. The focus on achieving great effects, ease of programming and lean efficiency has attracted some major players to EFL, such as Samsung Electronics. EFL is being used in development for their next generation devices. Find out about EFL.
</abstract>
        <description>This presentation will cover the following:

+ What is EFL
+ How to get started
+ Some core concepts that may vary in EFL from other toolkits
+ Key EFL features
+ Why would an electronics giant choose a little-known toolkit
+ How you can use EFL effectively for fun and profit

        <abstract>Hear how LibreOffice is tackling our users demands both for an 'app', a web office suite, and a traditional fat client, and how we have fun while improving the software.</abstract>
        <description>As the world moves simultaneously either to the cloud or towards 'apps' - come hear how LibreOffice is tackling our users' needs in both of these (apparently conflicting) directions with the same code-base.

See a demo of the LibreOffice On-Line prototypem, grasp the technologies, understand the benefits and problems of this model of web provision, and hear how you can play with / adapt gtk+ / broadway to your application. Hear about our handset / tablet developments, and our ongoing work to get smaller and faster. See how almost all the work we do for these products helps the normal fat-client office experience too.

Finally, of course some degree of catch up with the progress of LibreOffice as a code-base and community as we ship our version 3.5 will be presented, along with pointers for how to get involved in development.</description>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Wayland is a new window system architecture aiming to be a good fit for everything from embedded and mobile devices to full-blown desktop environments. Wayland builds on most of the graphics driver, desktop and UI infrastructure we have today, but distills out just the display server functionality we actually use today. The toolkits, device
drivers, compositors and desktop environments we use today all play their parts, but the X server is essentially reduced to an awkward, 500kloc IPC mechanism.
In the talk we will look at where Wayland comes from, how our graphics stack has evolved to make Wayland feasible and the basics of how Wayland works. We are working towards a 1.0 release of the protocol libraries and the reference compositor, Weston, and we'll take a look at what will be in the release.

        <abstract>Greenlightforgirls.org is a Brussels-based, international NGO promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics to girls of all ages and backgrounds. We promote female role models from technical sectors to youngsters, and run events which inspire girls to study and pursue careers in technical areas, including computers. With this knowledge, we believe girls will save the world!

As EU Director and global Technology Chair of the greenlight for girls foundation I aim to:  1. Create awareness about the need to attract more youth - especially girls - to computer science-related studies and careers, and science/tech sectors, in general;  2. Showcase the global activities of our foundation (20 events around the world in just our first 1.5 years in existence); and 3. Seek support from the global FLOSS (women?) developer community for g4g initiatives specifically requiring their involvement to succeed.</abstract>

        <abstract>This talk is about taking pictures from above with a big latex balloon, helium,
strings, duct tape and CHDK, and making a nice video with the pictures using
python, GStreamer and OpenCV.
</abstract>
        <description>Some friends of mine and I got pretty busy last year on a crazy balloon
photography project. I want to share that experience, say what worked (helium,
CHDK, GStreamer)  and what didn't (crazy kite-balloon ideas, arduino
connectivity, and some other things, all due to a lack of time). Hopefully,
that would motivate hackers to get out of their basement and go do cool things
under the Sun.

        <title>Linux Kernel MultiPath TCP</title>
        <subtitle>An open source implementation of MultiPath TCP in the Linux Kernel</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>

        <language></language>
        <abstract>MultiPath TCP, a major extension to TCP, allows the simultaneous use of a smartphone's 3G and WiFi interface to increase throughput and better resilience.
We implement MultiPath TCP in the Linux Kernel, publicly available at http://mptcp.info.ucl.ac.be
</abstract>
        <description>TCP, the most used Transport Protocol on the Internet, does not allow the simultaneous usage of multiple Interfaces. Smartphones with 3G and WiFi interfaces would benefit from a simultaneous use of both interfaces.
MultiPath TCP is a major extension to TCP, allowing the use of multiple Interfaces for a single data-stream, without the need to modify the applications. This allows an increased throughput and better resilience to failures.

The IP Networking Lab (http://inl.info.ucl.ac.be) of the Universit&#233; Catholique de Louvain is implementing MultiPath TCP in the Linux Kernel. The publicly available source-code (http://mptcp.info.ucl.ac.be) modifies/adds about 10000 lines to the Linux Kernel's TCP-stack.

The implementation has shown very good performance. For example, a throughput of up to 15 Gbps across two 10 Gig interfaces, whereas regular TCP can only use a single interface and thus 10 Gbps.

We are now considering inclusion in the mainline kernel and would like to encourage people to test our implementation and/or submit patches to help improving it.

        <abstract>Dovecot is primarily an IMAP server, but nowadays it could also be used as a core for many other things: Rapid development of a feature rich email client, easily trying out your own IMAP protocol replacement, creating an IMAP proxy with mail filtering capabilities, and so on. Most of this is possible due to a new "imapc" mail storage backend, which makes Dovecot act as an IMAP client.</abstract>
        <description>Dovecot is a widely used open source IMAP/POP3 server. Its internal design is based around libraries, which aren't very IMAP-specific. This allows using the same libraries to implement any kind of email related products. This talk gives a quick overview about 3 rapidly developed product prototypes:

1. MH-like email client built entirely with shell scripts and doveadm tool. The client is capable of reading emails from any IMAP server, as well as having a local full text search index.

2. A server for XML-based "XMLMAP" email access protocol. This server was used by a friend of mine who wanted to create a prototype email client without bothering to learn the IMAP protocol. The best thing about it was that he could access his own mails from GMail by using the "imapc" backend, almost as if GMail itself had implemented XMLMAP.

3. An IMAP proxy that can modify the message body contents, such as transparently decrypting PGP encrypted mails.

        <abstract>Early last year, the EFL port of WebKit was missing all the fun in executing over 20000 tests found in WebKit's repository. Required tools have been written, bugs were fixed, and features were implemented in 2011. Progress, important milestones and lessons learned will be shown in this talk.</abstract>
        <description>In order to provide better stability and ensure that future developments won't break things without them getting noticed, testing are an important part of software engineering. The WebKit project contains in its repository more than 20000 tests, scattered among different categories; most common ports (Mac, Qt, GTK+, the various Chromium ports) were performing these tests regularly, but the EFL port was missing all the fun. Tools were written and integrated in WebKit's testing drivers and after 6 months of hard work, we were able to pass 99% of these tests (excluding ones that are platform-specific and the ones that tests unimplemented features). In this talk, one of the developers will talk about the progress obtained while writing these tools, important milestones, and lessons learned.</description>

        <abstract>What can you do with your collection of sheet music, when all you have is paper or plain scans?
You surely may feel frustrated if you are not ready for tedious sessions of manual typing.
Here, *O*ptical *M*usic *R*ecognition comes to the rescue. It transcribes sheet music images to MusicXML symbolic format. Doing so, music content gets really "usable", since it can now easily be played, printed, transposed, re-published, analyzed, searched, etc.</abstract>
        <description>*OMR* is difficult for a good reason: while text uses only horizontal lines, music combines the complexity of both vertical and horizontal directions.
Today, there are just a few commercial OMRs available, and only one open-source product under heavy development activity: *Audiveris*.

Audiveris is a Java application, using a neural network as its cornerstone.
Collaboration is welcome on the most notable foreseen developments:
- Smart coupling with MuseScore (Audiveris for the automatic OMR part, MuseScore for the interactive edition part),
- Integration with Tesseract OCR V3,
- Providing a web-based "OMR as a service",
- Automated evaluation of transcription results,
- Supporting microedition features to enable crowd-sourcing approaches.

        <abstract>Broadcast has generally been the realm of expensive hardware and software and in the main quite objectionable to the use of FOSS. This presentation will talk about the challenges with developing and deploying FOSS in the broadcast environment, using the Open Broadcast Encoder as the main example.</abstract>
        <description>This presentation will go into the technical, social and legal challenges of using FOSS in broadcasting; an industry viewed as highly sceptical of using FOSS directly. Nonetheless, the industry has passionate and dedicated individuals developing and slowly deploying FOSS. This presentation will use the development and deployment of the Open Broadcast Encoder, a FOSS application intended to replace expensive hardware encoders with commodity software as an example of FOSS can be incorporated into an industry not used to it.</description>

Thus, you hacked up a common CVS/SVN/Git/whatever repository and soft-link into $HOME. There is a better way and it's called vcsh.</abstract>
        <description>I will demonstrate, in order:

* the need for config management
* how fake bare git repos work
* what vcsh can do
* show a demo

        <title>LISPmob: enhanced network layer mobility solution</title>

        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightning</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Wouldn't it be great if our phones, tablets, laptops and other mobile gadgets could use the same IP (v4 and/or v6) address regardless of which network they are connected to? And all that without a fixed tunnel causing path stretch, while offering some advanced traffic management features? This talk will present the LISPmob project, which implements a network layer mobility solution based on the Locator/ID Separation Protocol.</abstract>
        <description>LISP stands for not just the programming language, but for the Locator/ID Separation Protocol as well, which is a soon-to-be-finalized IETF standard. LISP can be used to improve network layer mobility, by assigning a static Endpoint IDentifier (EID) to hosts, which are mapped to a Routing LOCator (RLOC) identifying the network point of attachment. Both EIDs and RLOCs are IP addresses. Transport layer connections use EIDs, while packets are traveling in dynamic point-to-point tunnels using RLOCs for encapsulation between hosts, thus avoiding path stretch.

The LISP Mobile Node specification enables maintaining the same IP address regardless of network attachment point, and address family combination. For example, a device can use an IPv4 address on an IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual stack network. Since a roaming event does not change the IP address used by transport layer, ongoing connections (such as a SIP call) are maintained. Additionally, nodes with several available interfaces can define active-backup, or active-active load balanced incoming traffic policies.

The LISPmob Project is an implementation of the above specification for Linux, consisting of two kernel modules and a user space daemon.</description>

        <type>lightning</type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>The ZIO framework is a novel way to manage laboratory input/output.
It handles both data and meta-data, and is designed for multi-MB-per
second I/O in distributed systems.</abstract>
        <description>ZIO is a framework for high-data-rate I/O.  The basic I/O item is a
block, made up of data samples and full meta-data information, so
input can be consumed offline and output cam be prepared in advance.
The main use cases are waveform generation and distributed
oscilloscopes, over possibly hundreds of systems spread over several
kilometers.  Within ZIO, the buffer and the trigger are first-level
objects, and both input and output have always been supported.  Data
flow is a pipeline made up of device, trigger and buffer; usually the
buffer is connected to char devices, but in-kernel users have been
written with minimal effort.

Code is being developed at http://www.ohwr.org/projects/zio and is
being submitted to the kernel.</description>

        <description>The Wishbone bus is an open source hardware computer bus intended to let different logic blocks within an integrated circuit communicate with each other. This talk will introduce a set of memory mapped data structures that allow designers to describe their own logic blocks.  Thus, for compliant chip designs, the operating system can enumerate the Wishbone bus inside the integrated circuits and load the appropriate drivers, similar to PCI or USB. The proposed specification is already being used in a set of FPGA based cards being developed at the Open Hardware Repository. By defining a new bus type within the Linux kernel, the driver for each board can register as a Wishbone controller and benefit from automatic enumeration.  The bus controller can use the information it retrieves to load or activate the appropriate set of drivers to manage either the whole board or the various peripherals that are attached to the internal Wishbone bus. Such a scheme greatly simplifies managing the variety of FPGA binary images, by allowing automatic division of the problem space. Even when a single driver is needed for the whole device-set within the internal bus, a standardized identification mechanism reliefs system administrators from manually matching FPGA images and software drivers.</description>

        <abstract>Dynamic taint analysis is a powerful technique to detect memory corruption attacks. Yet with typical overheads of an order of magnitude, it is not something you would choose to deploy in any production environment.  Minemu is a fast taint-tracking emulator for Linux which aims to be fast enough to be run on production systems.
</abstract>
        <description>Minemu is a fast, process-based taint-tracking emulator for Linux (x86, 32bit).  By keeping track of where untrusted data (such as data from the network) is copied to inside your program, and by subsequently checking whether this data is used to take control of the program, Minemu effectively protects against most memory corruption attacks, both for known and unknown vulnerabilities.  Tracking the flow of untrusted data during the execution of a program is slow because we effectively have to do an extra memory operation for each original memory operation.  However, by using a special memory layout and utilizing SSE registers, Minemu tries to keep the overhead to a minimum.</description>

        <abstract>The people who believe in free software and open education have a lot in common, but few shared projects. Wikiotics has run for three years as a one such hybrid project and in the process spent a lot of time talking about education at free software conferences and about free software at education ones. If you have ever wondered why there aren't more projects like Wikipedia out there, come hear about some of the difficulties and opportunities for Foss/Edu collaboration.</abstract>
        <description>Openness, sharing, collaboration, and everyone's right to use, for any purpose. With these shared values, the partnership between free software and education should be natural, yet too often these communities operate without ever interacting. At Wikiotics, a language instruction project built from our own free software, we have faced puzzled looks at every turn. As the only education project at free software conferences and the only free software project at education ones, we have talked to many people from both communities about our common values and learned a lot about the barriers to working together and the incredible potential for social change when we collaborate.  Come hear a little bit about our strategies for overcoming them. </description>

        <abstract>The Growl Project, started in 2004, is the de facto open source notification framework for Mac OS X, and it's currently used by a wide range of applications, such as Firefox, Chrome, Adium, Skype, Dropbox etc. In this talk, we will present Growl, the various Growl Extras, and the GNTP protocol used to send and receive notifications locally or over the network.</abstract>
        <description>We would like to present a brief history of Growl, as well the current state of the framework that handles notifications. We will also present the Growl Extras, applications developed by the Growl Team which use Growl to notify the user on various events (GrowlTunes, HardwareGrowler, GrowlSafari, Capster), and how easy it is to use the Growl framework to notify your users in your own applications.

We will also discuss the GNTP protocol, which is used to send and receive Growl notifications locally or over the network. GNTP is platform-agnostic, and there are already GNTP-compatible Growl alternatives for Windows and Linux. Thanks to the variety of bindings, it is easy to send Growl notifications between computers and any GNTP-compatible device.

Last but not least, we will briefly discuss the recent decision to use Apple's marketplace as a revenue stream in order to sustain the continued development of the growl project and the expansion of our efforts, without sacrificing our open source nature. </description>

        <abstract>This lightning talk will be an overview of the important features of PMD 5.0, from which a beta should be release before then.Introducing briefly what PMD does (static code control and analysis) and how it does it (using XPath to query over Abstract Syntax Tree provided by pre-compilation), the talk will focus on the more important enhancement of this version: multi language support, mostly achieved by the great work of Ryan Gustavson between 2009 - 2010. With this features, PMD can be easily extend to support a large set of languages, including already XML based languages and ECMAScript (more commonly designated by the name JavaScript)</abstract>

        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightning</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>UI development usually consists in building software components that rely on a business data model. But business data models need to change frequently to adapt user requirement updates. This implies to adapt frequently the UI components.

Nowadays, existing solutions provide a way to support these changes by providing code generation and data binding. But, these solutions are still slow. Then, the development cost increases rapidly if you have frequently requirement updates and/or many UI components.

Wazaabi aims to reduce this cost by providing a solution based on models which doesn't require code generation. Based on Eclipse EMF, Wazaabi provides an open source framework that implements a dynamic declarative UI mechanism. The Wazaabi framework is directly based on the business data model and will evolve with it.

This presentation aims to give a look inside this framework.</abstract>
        <description>Wazaabi is an open source framework for declarative live UI-model. In this term two different concepts are included.
* The declarative UI, means that Wazaabi enables the designer to describe the UI declaratively.
* Model means that the declaration build an instance of a model of the GUI. A model is a conceptual representation of the UI.
* Live model means that we do not generate code from the Model as it is usually the case with the MDA approach. In Wazaabi the UI is a running instance of the model and an engine is responsible for  rendering the model in the target UI technology (SWT, SWING, JSF, etc.)</description>

        <abstract>The DMTF CIMI specification describes the model and protocol for management interactions between a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider and the consumers of an IaaS service. The basic entities of IaaS (machines, storage, and networks) are modeled with the goal of providing consumer management access to an implementation of IaaS and facilitating portability between cloud implementations that support the specification. This talk will introduce the current work-in-progress CIMI specification and the initial implementation of that spec. as part of the Apache Deltacloud project. </abstract>
        <description>Deltacloud exposes the CIMI API to HTTP clients and then facilitates management of IaaS resources across a number of heterogeneous cloud providers, even when those providers are non-conformant with respect to the CIMI specification.

The DMTF Cloud Management Working Group is a collaboration between a number of prominent participants, including Red Hat, VMware Inc., Oracle, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Huawei, Fujitsu, Dell, Telefonica, Telecom Italia, France Telecom Group and others.</description>

        <abstract>I've been moving the site operations model of the Wikimedia infrastructure from being a closed, mainly staff-only, model to an open to all model of contributions. I'm treating operations like an open source project, using Puppet, OpenStack and Git. The bottleneck of the operations team is greatly lessened, allowing volunteer contributions to be accepted and implemented much faster.

In this presentation, I'll describe the architecture of the Wikimedia Labs project, and how we are utilizing it to allow anyone to push changes from ideas to production. I'll also describe how this same model can apply to other open source projects, and also how it could apply more generally in private cloud implementations.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source virtualization platform based on the Xen hypervisor. XCP isn't a server application which you install alongside of Xen, but rather an "embedded" appliance, which manages your host. While this gives XCP developers the ability to provide a tightly controlled, well integrated system, it makes it more difficult for FOSS developers to use and modify our software. To correct this, we have recently ported the XCP toolstack to run on Debian; it is currently in Debian unstable and will be in the next release of Ubuntu.

In this presentation, we would like to demonstrate the XCP toolstack running on Ubuntu. We will show how easy it is to use the toolstack to create and manage virtual machines, and how you can use XCP and XenServer management tools with the XCP toolstack on Ubuntu. We will also demo our software running OpenStack.</abstract>

        <language></language>
        <abstract>The time has come to make the switch from embedded Linux to embedded BSD....
In this talk we will focus on the building of embedded appliances in the BSD world,
and more specifically on using NanoBSD to create FreeBSD images that run on
embedded systems.
In the stock FreeBSD distribution an application (script) called NanoBSD is present
that takes a configuration file and builds an image for a flash disk which then can be
used on an embedded system. A short cookbook will be presented on the steps
needed to actually create the image, and deploy it. Also the in-system upgrading of
the image will be discussed.
The use case we will present is an Stratum 0 NTP appliance that serves as network
time server using GPS with PPS synchronization. This appliance is capable of
providing highly accurate time service to a network of servers and desktop
machines, even when disconnected from the internet. The example will use a Soekris
4501 embedded board and an OEM hockey puck-style GPS device and some tricks to
use the high-res timing on the board, together with a temperature controlled crystal
oscillator.

        <abstract>IIO (Industrial I/O) is a new kernel subsystem to allow easy userspace
interaction with data capture devices (ADCs, DACs, accelerometers,
light sensors, etc), while maintaining a high level of performance.

Based on a recent driver contribution using this subsystem, we will
detail how to build a simple driver using this subsystem and explore
how to use advanced features like triggered captures or buffering. We
will also explore IIO user space API and how to use it.</abstract>

        <abstract>Due to the nature of the new SoC architectures the Power Management
needs a new model for the various system latencies.

The talk presents:
- the concepts of system, devices, wake-up and resume latencies,
- the recent changes in the devices framework for the latency, why and
how to make it generic,
- the recent changes in the ARM/OMAP platform code for the system latency,
- the problems encountered while modeling and measuring the various latencies,
- a proposal on the model,
- the planned changes in the device framework, the platform code and the APIs.

This talk is oriented towards Linux power management developers and
users. The generic model covers all flavors of Linux, from the
embedded device up to the multi processor computing server.</abstract>

        <abstract>Android is rapidly becoming the primary vector through which open source software is entering into people's life, with new devices being announced almost daily. Unfortunately companies are cutting many corners, especially when it comes to licenses and quality assurance, because everyone is rushing their devices to market. The consequence is that many Android devices out there are not compliant with the licenses, with significant legal risk as a result, even though it is completely avoidable with a small investment in time and knowledge up front, saving a lot of time and money down the line. In this talk I want to highlight a few common violations, shatter a few myths about Android and provide some hints on how to improve the situation. This talk will not be about software patents</abstract>

        <abstract>This presentation will be delivered in two sections, first an
introduction to the OpenRISC project by Julius Baxter, followed by a
look at embedded hardware development with Open Source IP cores using
the OpenRISC platform and the IP available on OpenCores.org with Olof
Kindgren.

The OpenRISC Project:

This project is aimed at developing embedded RISC microprocessor
architectures and open source RTL implementations. Since its beginning
in 1999, the project has attracted anyone interested in CPU
development and covers everything from ISA definition to RTL
description writing and testing to simulator, tool chain and operating
system porting. The presentation will cover the motivation, recent
progress and future plans of the project.

Open Source Embedded Hardware Development:

Most Open Source embedded developers end their quest for a fully Open
Source system when they get the data sheets. For the FPGA/ASIC
developers at OpenCores, this is where the fun part begins. Instead of
relying on the kindness of the chip manufacturers to deliver the
desired SoC functionality, Open Source hardware developers simply
design their own with the standard peripherals and custom hardware
acceleration that of choice. This requires Open Source IP cores and a
framework to put it all together.

This presentation will contain an introduction to some of the benefits
of open source hardware and an overview of OpenCores. The main focus
will be on how to use the OpenRISC Reference Platform System on Chip
(ORPSoC) to build a custom SoC, which will be demonstrated on the
OpenRISC FPGA development board.</abstract>

        <language></language>
        <abstract>Mobile text input requires easy copy'n'paste interaction, reliable
cursor positioning and the ability to edit (or fix) previously written
text. For Asian markets, computer-assisted input of composed characters
is of paramount importance. A virtual keyboard alone cannot solve that.
For input methods to work, sophisticated platform and toolkit
integration is required.

The current general-purpose APIs that come with their respective input
method modules in UI toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt are not sufficiently
equipped for these tasks. Although the situation within the toolkits is
slowly improving, Maliit - a flexible and cross-platform input method
framework - can further narrow this functionality gap.

This talk will analyze problems of mobile text input and show how they
were solved on Nokia's N9.</abstract>

to collaborate around a common base: OpenEmbedded-Core, with additional
layers being developed to be used on top. Moving to a multi-layer structure
presents both organisational advantages and challenges.

This presentation will cover both technical and community aspects and will
include recent developments in Yocto Project / OpenEmbedded structure, the
current layer landscape, best practices for developing new layers and growing
existing ones, and layer tooling enhancements developed as part of the Yocto
Project that will benefit the entire OE community, as well as future plans
along those lines.</abstract>

After showing two past examples of big structural changes, I will
introduce the current effort to redesign large parts of the OpenWrt
user space components.
This redesign aims to bring some interesting approaches from the
Desktop Linux world over to Embedded, without bringing along the
amount of bloat that is usually associated with them.</abstract>

        <abstract>One part of the integration of upstream software in a distribution is to correctly deal with changes that have a wide impact, either because they affect a lot of other software, or because the changes will be highly visible to the users. And it is easy to feel that such changes are always going wrong: some applications stop working, many users complain about the change they feel was uncalled for, nearly nobody shares a thank you note.

Such wide-impact changes always come with controversies, and being the bridge between users and upstreams, distributions are the place where all the rage is going on, with a social aspect that is usually at least as important as the technical side of things.

The recent years have not been exempt of controversies, and we will share our experiences with user-visible changes such as the move to KDE 4, GNOME 3 and systemd.

This talk will be co-presented by the SUSE Gang: Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Crozat, Will Stephenson, Vincent Untz.

        <abstract>Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a Debian-derived distribution focused on enterprise environments and heavily based on LDAP.
In contrast to most other Debian-derived distributions it is based on Debian stable instead of snapshots from Debian unstable.

With it's earliest development roots dating back ten years, UCS is now used in approx. 700 installations with the biggest having 80,000 users.
</abstract>
        <description>This technical talk will cover the following topics:
- Basing on Debian stable: Benefits and challenges
- Introduction to a few features specific to UCS:
* Template-based configuration management with Univention Configuration Registry
* "Listener/notifier" domain replication
* Synchronisation of OpenLDAP and Active Directory using the Univention AD Connector
* Web-based administration with the Univention Management Console
- UCS is the first distribution to include Samba 4 in a supported product

The talk will provide an overview of the supported features, e.g. assigning group policy objects to Windows clients.

        <abstract>Testing is an important task. But testing daily development-snapshots of a Linux-distribution would mean testing the same things every day, which would be pretty tiresome to testers. Yet, no one likes to break his system with untested code.

This presentation will be about my solution to this problem, using automated testing with KVM or VirtualBox for openQA.openSUSE.org to guarantee some minimum quality.  This will show some unique features like audio-testing, GUI-testing, and support for multiple distributions like Debian, Archlinux and Fedora. It will also have installation videos which are cool, fun and useful.

        <abstract>FOSS distributions are increasingly over pressure to deliver stable releases including the most up to date upstream software. Time-based release strategies has exacerbated this problem putting even more pressure on QA teams.

The recently concluded Mancoosi project has developed a number of tools to automatically analyse large packages collections for a range of problems, from
installability checks to speculative analysis of software repositories.

In this talk I'll present four command line tools to identify and correct potential problems as soon as possible during the release cycle.
</abstract>
        <description>In particular :
* Debcheck: This tools helps to identify all broken packages within a repository and provides a detailed explanation of the problem. This can be used to prevent shipping releases that contain packages that cannot be installed because of missing or malformed dependencies.
* Buildcheck: Given a Sources file and a set of binary repositories, this tool identifies those source packages that cannot be compiled because their build dependencies cannot be satisfied.
* Outdated: This tool identifies those broken packages that need special attention because of outdated meta-data.
* Challenged: This tool performs a speculative analysis of the repository to identify those packages that, if upgraded to a specific version, would break a large number of other packages in the repository. This tool would be particularly useful during the upgrade of a specific component to evaluate its impact on the software archive.

Most of our tools support both rpm (version 4 and 5) and deb based distributions.

        <abstract>At the [AppInstaller2011](http://distributions.freedesktop.org/wiki/Meetings/AppInstaller2011) meeting I started writing [Distromatch](http://www.enricozini.org/2011/debian/distromatch/) which is able to map binary package names across different distribution using a wide set of euristics.

Distromatch has the potential of being a radical change in cross-distro cooperation, enabling exchange of package screenshots, categories, ratings, reviews and many other interesting kinds of metadata.

Since distromatch has existed for almost a year and (afaik) so far none of this has happened, I am taking advantage of the cross-distro room to show how it works and discuss how to move on from here.

        <abstract>Debian has a number of legacy tools (that's a euphemism for ugly hacks) that are not addressed due to inertia, fear of breaking stuff, and the difficulty of reaching consensus for changes with cross-package impact. I'll talk about dealing with the above issues in the context of ongoing work as part of Debian Enhancement Proposal 9.

Specifically, the talk will cover how (not) to make proposals for cross-package changes, and how to map behaviour in a technical spec to feature-centered assertions in a test suite.

        <abstract>Multiarch is a properly generic solution to the installation and use of library packages from one than one architecture at a time, which changes the way running non-native binaries and crossbuilding are dealt with in a fundamental way. It is both powerful and intrusive and has taken a long time to make happen.

This talk explains what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. We will also discuss future adoption by other distros.

        <abstract>Project-Builder.org is a GPL v2 tool designed to help projects developers producing easily packages for multiple OS and architectures, on a regular basis, from
+a single source repository.

The various aspects covered by the tool are:
- only produce software packages (ease integration in deployment servers, provide inheritance mecanisms, ...)
- ease the various steps of solution life cycle (controlled impact of installation/uninstallation, dependencies management, identical deliveries up to customer,
+announce management, web site delivery, metadata management)
- help projects packages provisioning (templates/skeletons, generated structure)
- Avoid code/metadata duplication (macro system, separate repository)
- Neutral (repository, system, package type agnostic)
</abstract>
        <description>Reduces cost by providing process, method and tools to realize continuous packaging during the whole project life cycle.

Today the tool supports:
- Muliple repository (tarballs, SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial, SVK...)
- Multiple systems ((RPM Linux, deb Linux, ebuild , Solaris pkg)
- Multiple build environments (local, VM, VE)
- Multiple repository manager (yum, urpmi, apt)

        <abstract>GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that
provides abstractions to cater for a whole range of multimedia needs,
whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia
middleware; embedded systems, desktops or server farms.

GStreamer 1.0 is the next generation of the successful GStreamer 0.10.x
API series where some of the core API has got a complete overhaul to
address many of the limitations we have run into over the years with the
old API. In many respects, 1.0 will be pretty much the same as 0.10, but
in others it will be radically different.

This talk is a high-level overview of what's been happening in the world
of GStreamer as of late, with a special focus on the status of GStreamer
1.0, highlighting some of the improvements it will bring.</abstract>

        <abstract>Bill Hoffman, the original CMake developer, and Alexander Neundorf the
architect of the KDE CMake Build system will talk about the full capabilities of CMake as a
build tool. They will cover both the basics of getting started with CMake, and some really cool
features that allow for the cross platform building of entire packages of software. This will be
demonstrated with example projects using the gtk as well as the Qt toolkit. They will also give
some interesting historical notes on CMake. Covered topics will include:
* The basics
* Debugging your CMake build system
* Integrating 3rd party packages in the build using ExternalProject
* Creating source and binary packages using CPack
* Continuous Integration testing with CDash/CTest and cdash@home
* Installing your CMake-based library - exporting and importing targets
* Cross-platform scripting with CMake (cmake -E, cmake -P, file(DOWNLOAD ...) )
* Lots of fun historical notes on the development of CMake and the KDE CMake build
system

        <abstract>I've written a modest desktop application to manage my Altus Metrum
rocketry electronics. The first implementation used C and Gtk+. I
eventually gave up on that implementation and started over using Java
and Swing. The application now consists of about 25kloc using a
collection of external java packages for things like speech synthesis,
graphing and mapping. This presentation will describe what my experience
with Gtk+ was like and why I was motivated to start over.</abstract>

        <abstract>Tumbler is a D-Bus service that generates thumbnails for various kinds
of applications. Clients can pick from several schedulers and thumbnail
flavors depending on their needs. Tumbler provides a plugin interface
via which the list of supported file types can be extended. It already
ships thumbnail plugins for videos, fonts, images, ODF documents, 
PDF/PS documents and RAW images. Thanks to its support for delegating 
thumbnail request to specialized third-party services, Tumbler can also
be used with closed source thumbnail generators.

Originally written for Xfce and its Thunar file manager, Tumbler was
later integrated in MeeGo and is now used on the N9 as well. In this
talk, I will explain the features, design, and usage of Tumbler as well
as its current limitations. The ultimate goal is to make application and
desktop developers aware of it and motivate them to adopt Tumbler in
their software. The talk will include a live demonstration.</abstract>

        <abstract>Every Detail Matters is a new initiative that aims to focus attention
on improving specific areas of the GNOME 3 user experience. It also
aims to provide an easy way for people to make a valuable contribution
to GNOME by identifying development tasks that would make a real
difference.

The initiative involves designers working closely with both new and
experienced developers to refine GNOME 3. We are working towards
delivering a major and tangible improvement to the next release,
version 3.4.

In this talk I will describe the key features of Every Detail Matters,
demo some of the progress that has been made thanks to the initiative,
and will show how you can participate to make GNOME 3 better than
ever.</abstract>

        <abstract>Telepathy is an instant messaging, Voice over IP and videoconferencing
cross-desktop framework with backends for today's most popular protocols.
Its modular and flexible architecture built around D-Bus enables developers
to easily create communications applications with interchangeable
components. A small team inside the KDE community is working on Telepathy
integration into KDE Workspaces. This talk should provide an insight into
the current state of KDE-Telepathy development, its plans and possibilities.</abstract>
        <description>The KDE Telepathy team aims to deliver an Instant Messaging experience
fully integrated into the workspace, built on top of Telepathy
technologies. Thanks to the active upstream development of Telepathy itself
(including protocol backends), the KDE Telepathy team can better focus on
the user interfaces and their integration with Plasma Desktop. Both teams
cooperate very closely and it is great example of upstream-downstream teams
working together. This talk should briefly cover Telepathy architecture and
its current usage "in the wild", then the talk will mainly focus on
Telepathy in KDE Workspace and Applications - brief project history,
overview of ready to use components, plans for the near and far future and

        <abstract>LibreOffice has many features for accessible authoring: it provides functionality to use the accessibility features of the OpenDocument Format (ODF), it supports export to tagged PDF (unlike most other free and open-source tools), it has extensions for exporting to digital audio books (odt2daisy) and Braille (odt2braille), and an extension for evaluating and repairing accessibility issues in ODT, DOC and DOCX (AccessODF). It also implements accessibility APIs to enable users of assistive technologies to use the office suite. However, there is room for improvement, both with regard to the creation of accessible content and with regard to the accessibility of LibreOffice itself. This presentation will discuss both types of issues. It will highlight bugs and feature requests that could be addressed to make it easier to create accessible content, and issues related to the support for accessibility APIs. </abstract>

        <abstract>Dialogs in LibreOffice are horrifically ugly, mostly because all widgets contained within them and the dialog themselves are typically fixed size and sized to contain the text of the longest translation. The other reason they are ugly is because they are so painful to edit. There's been plenty of proposals and attempts to fix them. Here's another one.</abstract>

        <description>The HelpIM chat software is about 10 years old now. We have rewritten it three times and with each rewrite we managed to make some major screw-ups. Recurring issues are: "how to reliably deliver the chat over the web", "how to route the messages within the server" and "how to authenticate over both HTTP and XMPP". With this talk I will save you from making the same screw-ups as we did.</description>

        <abstract>How to use a combination of XMPP PubSub and MUC to have Web widgets communicate with each other on the example of Personal Learning Environments.</abstract>
        <description>In the domain of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) a current research focus is on widget-based personal learning environments (PLE). Learners mash-up their favorite Web widgets to complete learning applications running in any Web browsers. Furthermore, learners socialize, communicate or even collaborate with their peers using real-time technologies. In the context of the EU large-scale integrating Open Source project ROLE (Responsive Open Learning Environments; http://role-project.eu; http://sourceforge.net/projects/role-project/), we employ XMPP in combination with recent Web technologies (e.g. XMPP over WebSocket) on a wide basis to realize communication and collaboration use cases within such browser-based PLE. Beneath the usage of regular features such as roster lists, online presence, IM and MUC we developed a framework for Interwidget Communication (IWC) based HTML5 Web Messaging (local) and XMPP PubSub (remote) as well as a payload format inspired by Google Android Intents. Developers can thus design their widgets to communicate with each other even across multiple users and browsers. This framework can optionally be enhanced with trust-awareness features. In this talk we present the results of our work with a focus on remote interwidget communication and report on our experiences with XMPP over BOSH/WebSocket.</description>

        <abstract>A new project whose distinguishing feature is not reinventing the wheel.</abstract>
        <description>Recently, Dave discovered a batch processing protocol called Hututupuh. Looking into it (it's apparently quite popular), he noticed a habit of Hututupuh developers to reinvent often key areas, such as endpoint identifiers, authentication, and notifications.

Since the XMPP world has had these working just fine for quite a while (usually by reusing things like SASL), Dave wondered what would happen if you let XMPP do some of the heavy lifting. Hututupuh developers will, now doubt, rejoice at having a simple, ready-made solution available to them, with a pre-existing global infrastructure and wide support.</description>

        <abstract>Why Webfinger is so important, why BrowserId is so important, and how to combine the two.</abstract>
        <description>The federated social web needs to be a tool-agnostic web. A user should be able to interact with other users, regardless of whether the other user is using xmpp-based tools, or OStatus-based tools, even SMTP, and maybe even SMS. But there is one central corner stone of socializing: user addresses. These can be email addresses, Jabber ID's, or webfinger account URIs.

In this talk I'll discuss some of the challenges of enabling people to own their user address. In particular, I will discuss our experiences in both the LibreDocs project and the Opentabs project, about why Webfinger is so important, why BrowserId is so important, and how to combine the two.</description>

        <abstract>Implementation of PubSub, Service Discovery and User Location on top
the Dutch Railways API.</abstract>
        <description>Dutch Railways has opened up an API to their presentation layer. The
API hooks into the back office and contains similar data as can be
found on stations and their website. The system is pull based, and has
a limitation of 40k request per unique API key, the format: XML.

The openOV project removed the requirement for the API key by acting
as open proxy, caching request and offering a PubSub allowing
subscriptions to specific stations. Upon changes any subscriber gets
informed, in realtime. Additional views in virtual nodes were made to
retrieve data of a single train passing by stations.

Some commercial partners popped up such as &lt;http://42transit.com&gt;
doing BOSH, to our service.</description>

        <abstract>Motivations for real-time text in XMPP, the seamless addition of the feature, the protocol in XEP-0301, and its use.</abstract>
        <description>    The presentation describes the functionality of real-time text added
    to the XMPP environment by draft extension XEP-0301.
    By application to both sending and receiving XMPP clients, a more
    fluent conversation by text is achieved, where text is displayed at
    the far end at the rate it is typed by the transmitting party.
    This reduces stress and waiting time in intensive text communication
    situations.   

    The extension can be seamlessly applied, so that if it is not
    supported by both ends, the functionality is as plain message based
    XMPP. Therefore introduction can be made gradually.
    In order to not overload servers and networks, the trasmission
    itervals can be kept long, and instead the real-time impression get
    recreated by a feature called "Natural Typing". 

    Opportunities for interoperability with real-time text in other
    environments will be explained, and indications given for easy
    integration in other XMPP implementations.

    Demonstrations will be made of the RealJabber client, implementing
    the draft as an open source project, managed by the author of the
    XEP-0301 draft, Mark Rejhon.

    It is with the experience, need and interest from people with
    communications related disabilities that this extension is
    developed, but it has apparent benefits for all.</description>

        <abstract>In a highly connected world like ours is trust one of the most important assets. But what if the root to trust is not trustworthy?

 2011 was the year where one Certificate Authority (CA) after the other
 came to fall. The cases of the Dutch DigiNotar and the Malaysian 
 DigiCert are the best know. The system of commercial CAs depends on a
 wrong understanding of liability and trust. CAcert's web of trust
 tries to overcomes the liability issues by trusting a group of trusted
 people wherein each individual is liable for its own action.

 This talk enlightens why most commercial CAs are not trustworthy by
 default, what we can learn from 2011's cases, what makes CAcert
 different, why CAcert is not in the browsers by default and what we do
 to make it happen.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Openmoko Freerunner, the open source and HW mobile phone, is alive and kicking. During this talk we provide a status of the current active and stable platforms ported to the Freerunner (SHR, QtMoko, Android and Debian).</abstract>
        <description>The community is also producing the newcomer with codename GTA04. The device is already available for pre-ordering. The new phone is 3,75G enabled, has superior characteristics compared to the Freerunner (GTA02)  and fits in the current Freerunner casing. During the talk we will shed some light on the status of the project.</description>

        <abstract>Qt has had a support for embedding accelerated native OpenGL code inside Qt applications, but hardware graphics acceleration has been always a bottleneck on Linux platforms due to lack of proper support and driver openness. The situation is getting better every day, and with hard effort there are now several hardware acceleration capable Linux devices either in the market already, or coming in a few months. Combined with capabilities of Qt version 5, including QML SceneGraph and OpenGL Shaders in QML called ShaderEffects, the possibilities are endless. 2D or 3D UI's with 60fps on a mobile Linux device is not only a dream these days.

</abstract>
        <description>Qt framework has been popular amongst desktop developers already more than a decade. In few last years it has been gaining similar popularity amongst mobile developers. Since Qt is well supported on many mobile Linux platforms, including Maemo, MeeGo, MeeGo Harmattan and Mer, it has become a first class citizen on mobile Linux devices. 

The project presented here (has no name yet) has an aim to form a vibrant community to create a free and open sourced resource collection of QML Shader Effects for 2D and 3D to be used freely in stunning mobile device UI's of devices as N9, N950 or Raspberry Pi.</description>

about the community transition from MeeGo to Tizen. We'll do a quick recap
from past year of the MeeGo community along with some things we learned
along the way. The rest of the presentation will talk about what we are
doing to form the Tizen community and how you can participate.
I'll also gather feedback during the Q&amp;A on what you would like to see us
do differently in the Tizen community.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Nokia N9 phone has recently been released to the public, running the shiny
MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan. External developers were able to get such devices via
several mediums. Qt is at the center of this platform. It provides a great set
of tools and libraries that make this device very accessible and give an
excellent way to learn Qt development; also to experiment with KDE Mobile
application development. In this presentation the KDE Mobile development
workflow will be presented. Practically almost everything you need to know about
how to make or port a KDE application for those gadgets and how to make the most
out of the development tools.</abstract>
        <description>During the presentation, there will be some notes about general hints and the
development environments potentially available. We will see how to package your
KDE Application for testing and later publishing. You can pick up technical tips
and tricks for free that others have already spent a decent amount of time with.
There will be some practical hints about application testing methodologies, and
in general how to survive with the security framework from an authorized person
regarding the topic. Last, but not least: you will see how to cooperate with Ovi
store and their QA requirements. We will also have a look at the newly formed
"Apps For MeeGo", community driven store. In other words, the idea of the
publishing story. Speaking of which, the Community OBS will also be presented
along with the fallback KDE repository for distributing packages for developer
purposes. In the end, we will have a small demo session about the already
available KDE applications for this mobile handset platform.</description>

        <abstract>At the moment it is hard to find out what kind of Qt apps have been
developed in the community, for various devices eg. Nokia N9, MeeGo
tablets or Mer/Nemo. This is a missed opportunity for everybody.
However we have such a system already in place, that is Apps for MeeGo
(apps.formeego.org). It has all of the basic pieces in place already,
and has been developed with the same folks who brought as the Maemo
extras. In this talk I present the current status of apps.formeego.org
(with demo(s)), and ask the question: can we build one central "app
store" for community Qt applications? What is in place already, and
what needs to be done?</abstract>

        <abstract>Maliit is an open source project for enabling first-class text input solutions for mobile devices. The project aims to provides a reference solution for easy integration, and a framework that others can build upon. It also strives to work closely with the wider community to improve mobile text input on open platforms. Current examples include its use in MeeGo, Nemo Mobile and Maemo Fremantle, the integration in Qt Components and Libmeegotouch, and improvements made to Qt and GTK+ input method interfaces.</abstract>
        <description>Reviews of mobile devices most often include one or several sections about text input, and how well it works (or not). On-screen keyboard, language support, copy-paste and selection handling, error correction and word prediction, are all fundamental to a good end-user experience.

The talk aims to highlight the importance of, and challenges in implementing, modern mobile text input methods on open mobile platforms. It also serves to encourage cross-project collaboration to overcome these challenges and explains how Maliit can provide a solid foundation for this collaboration.

        <abstract>Nemo Mobile is a linux distribution that is based on Mer Core and is using MeeGo Handset UX as its UX at the moment. Probably the easiest way is to think that the Nemo Mobile continues where MeeGo Community Edition (MeeGo CE) left off, with the main difference that it uses Mer as the core instead of MeeGo. In this talk the current status of the project is shown as well as the basics of how community can contribute to the project.</abstract>

        <title>An update on PIM storage and sync: SyncEvolution</title>
        <subtitle>(now with KDE support, CalDAV/CardDAV synchronization, and ActiveSync) and Evolution Data Server (improved API and performance)</subtitle>
        <track>Open Mobile Linux Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>SyncEvolution has been the main synchronization engine in Moblin, MeeGo (together with Buteo) and will also be used in
Tizen. In addition there have been stable, regular upstream releases for desktop Linux since 2005. Ports to the N900 and N9
are available, using their native PIM storage. This talk will give an overview of the architecture and introduce the latest features: KDE support, CalDAV/CardDAV synchronization, and ActiveSync.
</abstract>
        <description>The slides can be viewed at http://syncevolution.org/blogs/pohly/2012/fosdem-2012

PIM storage and synchronization are important topics on mobile
devices because of the central role that the data plays and the
intermittent network connectivity - thus the need to keep local
copies of important data and synchronize when online.

One (but not the only) supported storage backend is Evolution
Data Server. When Nokia left MeeGo, Intel reverted back to EDS
as the main storage for PIM data in MeeGo and started to improve
it. The initial round of improvements were aimed at minimizing
overhead for sync and have been accepted by the upstream
project. This talk summarizes these changes and outlines some
further ideas.</description>

        <abstract>"Apple drops GPL apps" was a headline in the Linux User &amp; Developer Magazine in 2011. Later Windows followed the example of Apple. So does this mean GPL licensed apps can't go mobile? Luckily, it's not that dramatic. This talk will share the first hand experience of the challenges and opportunities of releasing GPL based apps in the Apple app store.</abstract>

        <abstract>Getting to the point of having a working, low-resource DLNA-ready
implementation is a hard task. Fortunately there's an easy way out -
Rygel. It is a modular and extensible solution to help you out of that
dilemma with minimum effort.

Rygel started its life for GNOME Mobile and was the designated UPnP/DLNA
stack for Maemo Freemantle and MeeGo/Harmattan. It is supposed to work
out-of-the box with no setup required, operating nicely with all kinds
of quirky devices.

        <description>Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is that the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of software engineering. If you prefer to spend your time on designing elegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think that software should not fail, if you like to build programs from readily available components that you can trust, you should really consider Ada!</description>

        <abstract>Using Ada to provide business logic, and glue existing applications together.</abstract>
        <description>The children's game universe "Crimeville" from the game developers Art of Crime challenges the players to solve detective riddles cooperatively. In the on-line version of the game this means that the players in each session of the game can chat with each other. To help the children write better - and to limit them being naughty - the chat is going through a language server written in Ada.
The language server uses pre-existing Open Source spell-checking components glued together with application logic written in Ada. The application is a nice example of a small network server and of using parts of the POSIX Ada API (FLORIST).
The presentation will cover the requirements from Art of Crime in broad terms, describe how this was achieved using publicly available Open Source components, and how using Ada helped convincing the customer that the system actually does its job.</description>

        <description>Ada had built-in support for parallel programming from the start, and the successive standards keep improving that support, up to most recently for the new multiprocessor architectures.
An overview of the support that already existed in Ada 83 and Ada 95 will be given, with practical examples so participants can try out some simple things first.
Ada 2012 comes with interesting additions for using multiprocessors effectively. Embedded systems can use an extension of the Ravenscar profile to achieve analyzable real-time behavior on multicore platforms. Ada's dispatching domains achieve flexible allocation schemes for high-performance computing.</description>

        <description>OS Lovelace already implements the basics of system programming and Ada run-time: interrupts (x86 and ARM), virtual memory management (x86 and ARM), elf module loading (x86 and ARM), context switching (x86), Ada exception in kernel (x86), Ada tasking in kernel (x86), Object Oriented programming in kernel (x86).
The final proposed architecture for a real OS based on these trial developments will also be presented and so the method to obtain a distributed OS that support Ada Annex E natively.</description>

        <description>LEGO MINDSTORMS are affordable and attractive robotics kits that can be used as teaching material, or as funny and interesting hobby. We have used this kit to design a Segway-like robot, where the control system is written in Ada and built with the GNAT compiler. The concurrency and real-time capabilities of the Ada Ravenscar profile are used to implement the dynamic interaction with the physical environment, respecting very stringent timing constraints.</description>

        <abstract>Ada enters into the peer-to-peer world.</abstract>
        <description>Peer-to-peer technologies have became commons nowadays. Initially developed for file sharing, the peer-to-peer approach is moving into the more challenging field of streaming. PPETP is a peer-to-peer streaming protocol, developed at the University of Udine, initially designed for streaming live material to large user communities and evolved with time into an efficient, generic overlay multicast protocol with many built-in features (e.g., signatures, NAT traversal, robustness, priority classes) that make it practical. After few years of development, adjustments and optimizations, PPETP is finally getting ready for its first public release. Its official specs are published as an Internet Draft, while its reference implementation is an open source Ada library (~1.5 Mbyte of source code) designed to be used, in the most common cases, with an interface similar to the well-known BSD socket interface. In this talk, after a brief overview of the most interesting characteristics of PPETP, we will discuss some of the most challenging aspects in its implementation and how Ada was instrumental to solve them.</description>

        <abstract>Looking into the future of Ada, not just as a programming language but as a basis for building highly reliable software.</abstract>
        <description>Ada is a language that is used for the construction of large critical programs, including safety-critical programs where an error can cost human lives. In looking into the future of Ada, we are doing more than just thinking about details of programming language design, we are really thinking about the whole issue of how to build reliable applications in a society which depends more and more on complex software. Ada is an interesting language precisely in that its development has been open from the start (it is one of the very few ISO standardized languages where you can get the ISO standard free, we insisted on that!) And the primary implementation of Ada these days is the GNAT system, which is 100% Free Software.
The Chevy Volt automobile has over 10 million lines of embedded code, more than the 8 million lines aboard a Boeing 787. Many times a day we place our lives at the mercy of complex software. How can we be sure this software will not let us down and kill us? This is not just a theoretical question, patients have already died at the hands of incorrectly programmed medical devices, and although no one has died from a bug in commercial aviation, we have had some horrifying close calls. Things are going to get worse and worse if we don't figure out how to deal with this situation.</description>

        <abstract>Open content licences are tools at the disposal of creative people who want to use their copyrights in a permissive manner. 
Their first aim is to allow the sharing and spreading of works, by granting rights to the users on a royalty-free basis. 
However, these licences remain binding legal documents, according to which licensees must respect some obligations, and which are enforceable before courts. 
The proposed presentation aims at providing an analysis of interesting court decisions where open content licences were at issue.

        <abstract>When changing laws threaten the FOSS community, it pushes back with activist campaigns lead by NGOs and non-profits.  These campaigns look much like the ones conducted by other groups of activists such as the human rights network.  When FOSS gets political, it typically uses a handful of common strategies.  This talk will build on information gathered from interviews and other research to describe what techniques free software advocates use when they try to influence government policy.  It will briefly evaluate their effect, taking examples from the ACTA campaign and from the reaction to proliferating three-strikes laws aimed at enforcing IP policy.  Then it will compare with other activist projects in other fields: FOSS advocates might expand their vocabulary of political action by borrowing the approaches used in other issue areas.

        <abstract>Modern software is typically composed of numerous components, such as third-party open source packages. To prevent legal or security problems, software vendors must identify the components (including their licenses) used to create the binaries they ship. This requires knowing exactly which source code files and other artifacts are used to create a given binary, and how they are used (e.g.whether libraries are statically or dynamically linked). In this talk I will we show a generic method to reverse-engineer this information from the build processes of software products. The method traces system calls to determine the composition graph of sources and binaries involved in build processes. </abstract>

        <abstract>The legal structures of free software projects go through phases of
popularity reminiscent of fashion trends. The early days of free
software were decentralized and individualistic, partially inspired by
the "free culture" movements of the '60s. Over time, centralization and
incorporated non-profit organizations grew popular, parallel with a
period of time where FLOSS was struggling for recognition as a viable
alternative to proprietary solutions. As FLOSS crested that wave, and
won the recognition of the business world, people began to recognize an
over-proliferation of special-purpose foundations, and the conservancies
(foundations that host multiple independent projects) came to the fore.
In the past year we've seen a movement back toward decentralized
individualism, questioning the need of any formal legal structures. The
fact of the matter is that free software and international law work just
fine for a whole gamut of legal structures, from the lone individual
hacker to the largest of incorporated entities. It's a free choice for
each project. The important thing is for every project to think through
their legal strategy. Not just the "What?" (-license? -contribution
policy? -legal documentation?) but "Why?" (-pick option X over option Y?
-are we doing this? -do we care?) and "How?" (-can we make this work for
us? -will this affect our users and developers?).</abstract>

        <abstract>When a company authors free software under the GNU GPL, it is likely that it will discover license violations. Non profit like FSF or Software Freedom Conservancy will try to resolve such violations amicably, because their mission is to further Free Software. They will only go to court as a last resort, if the infringer refuses to comply with the licenses and keeps distributing the software. The primary goal of a company is to generate profit, it will therefore take advantage of violations to this end. For instance, part of the former MySQL AB company business model was to threaten infringers and require that they buy a proprietary license to be redeemed. However, most of the infringements are honest mistakes and such methods are not in the best interest of the Free Software community. They are even counter productive for the company who makes short term profits but eventually scare their customers away.

* Numbers are increasingly being cited to show that the use of copyleft licenses, specifically the GPL, is declining. What do these numbers actually show, who is propagating them, and why? What do or might other numbers show?
* Is the "percentage of free software projects which use copyleft licenses" a useful way to judge the success of copyleft? Does an increase in the percentage of projects using non-copyleft permissive licenses indicate a failure of copyleft?
* As a small related case study, what role have the licensing terms of popular mobile application stores played in this debate, and how have those terms changed the frame of the discussion?

        <abstract>Discussion of the possible decline of copyleft licensing.</abstract>
        <description>During the past few years some have asserted that the use of
copyleft licenses, particularly the GPL, is in decline among
FLOSS projects. While the data that is said to support this
contention may be suspect, it matches my own observations and
experience.

I examine why the GPL may really be experiencing some decline
relative to noncopyleft licensing. Many factors are likely to
have played a part, sometimes in contradictory or nonobvious
ways, including the evolution of open source "business models",
the nature of GPL enforcement and nonenforcement, the drafting of
GPLv3 and its aftermath, changes in moral and legal authority
surrounding the GPL, and general technological, cultural and
economic developments affecting free software hackers.

If it is real, the GPL's decline is a problematic development for
free software culture. I propose ways in which the trajectory of
relevance and influence of strong copyleft can be turned around.

        <abstract>So-called "app stores" are becoming a popular means of distributing
software, particularly for mobile devices. However, the rise of app
stores has been accompanied by tensions with free software/open source
legal norms. Companies controlling official app distribution channels
for their platforms typically place restrictive terms on both users
and developers in ways that may be difficult or impossible to
harmonize with requirements and expectations around FLOSS
licensing. Moreover, there is a perception that noncompliance with
FLOSS licenses is prevalent in app store distribution. This panel will
explore some of the problems arising out of the intersection between
app stores and FLOSS, under EU as well as US law, and will discuss
possible solutions.</abstract>

        <title>Creative Commons 4.0 licenses and other opportunities for FLOSS/free culture legal/policy intersections</title>

        <abstract>Creative Commons has since its launch in 2002 acknowledged free
software as an inspiration, but in-depth communication and understanding
across the "free culture" (and education, science, government...) and
free software movements has been thin, resulting in missed opportunities
(at least on the free culture side).  Two developments make early 2012 an
opportune and necessary time to address this. First, Creative Commons has
kicked off a process which will eventually lead to the release of version
4.0 of various CC licenses, which ought incorporate the best wisdom about
public licenses (most of which resides in the free software community)
and not need to be versioned again for a decade. Additionally, among the
issues under discussion for CC 4.0 licenses are ones of direct import to
the free software community, including how DRM and license compatibility
are addressed. Second, CC licenses have become fairly widely adopted as
policy for public sector and publicly interested materials and funding,
especially in education. Free software and even open standards are
inadequately accounted for these developments, presenting a significant and
unappreciated threat to the realization of public benefit from such --
a continuation of the tendency of free culture (with the exception of
Wikimedia) being dependent on proprietary web silos. This talk will very
briefly summarize the relevant history, describe the pertinent CC 4.0
licenses and policy issues, and hopefully provoke solutions and actions
benefiting free software and free culture.</abstract>

        <abstract>1. An overview of the problem of dealing with multiple server processes on multiple hosts and sites.  How to provide fault tolerance and how to scale up without losing control.
2. A discussion of the use of the basic technologies such as Distributed Objects and property lists etc to implement these systems.
3. Control ... how we start/stop server processes, prevent duplication of processes, support automated restart, and query the state of processes.
4. Configuration ... how we provide specific configuration to each process under central control, yet allow those servers to operate independently.
5. Logging/Alarming ... how we provide and manage simple and consistent audit/debug logging facilities for server processes, and how we integrate with SNMP.</abstract>

        <abstract>With iOS 5 and OS X 10.7, Apple introduced a number of new Objective-C features. With the release of version 1.6 of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime and version 3.0 of clang these are now all available to GNUstep developers. The new features include better data hiding, automatic reference counting, and a number of other features. This talk will cover these features, as well as some of the extensions beyond Apple's version and the improvements in Objective-C performance since FOSDEM last year.</abstract>

        <abstract>We're living in hard times right now. Most of the F(L)OSS projects suffers from lack of volunteers especially if they must donate a large amount of time to this project. My talk will show how you can plan better your community how to measure it, how to use tips and tricks from the commercial world and how to use some agile methods and tools to make you community kick-ass squad. 

* How to plan your community for next couple of months; (ex. We need 3 more people to join our translation effort) and Create the Flow &#8211; how a bug report goes from bugzilla to the the end of it&#8217;s life. (a.k.a kill the bug)
* Define how to do it (ex. Troll the forums, create twitter campaign, contact universities, or something else?)
* How to Measure it (How many retweets do you have, how many clicks, etc) and Why?
* How to find patterns into your community and how to use them. For example &#8211; Most of the answers I receive to my mailing comes during business hours OR Friday is not a good day to send emails
* What is Agile and how to use it to make my community life easier? ( Trello show-case ) </abstract>

        <abstract>The plans for Firefox in 2012 are huge. However, hacking on Firefox has a huge learning curve, and requires specialists with experiential knowledge of a sea of undocumented code and familiarity with a host of implicit behaviors that are impossible to predict. The risk of regression, even after years of requiring tests, is still quite high. New features continue to take far longer than we expect, and we continually rely on the same small group of people to develop them, and an even smaller group to review them. How can we make the development of Firefox easier for new contributors, as well as ourselves? I'll talk about new approaches towards feature development and contributor interaction that can reduce the time required and risk involved in Firefox development.

The aim of this project is to produce an apps eco-system on the Web that uses open technologies and gives developers and users the freedom to sell and use apps in the way they want.

Aside from the conceptual issues that this project tackles, Rob will also cover some of the JavaScript APIs that are being worked on to provide the necessary functionality for apps. It is these APIs that allow developers to create an immersive experience within their apps that they wouldn't have been able to achieve in the browser until now.</abstract>

        <abstract>Boot2Gecko (B2G) is a complete OS built on the open web platform.  Every "app" from the lock screen to the phone dialer is a "web app", built with HTML/JS/CSS.  Where we encounter gaps in the open web platform as compared to other phone OSes, we plug the gaps with new Web APIs, to be standardized by web standards bodies.  If you know how to write a web page, you will be able to write phone apps.  B2G is developed according to Mozilla's values: in the open, with source code always available, and on open standards.  In this talk, we'll discuss the motivation for B2G and some of its implementation.  And of course, there will be a demo!</abstract>

        <abstract>BoxGrinder is a set of tools that help you grind out appliances: preconfigured disk images with the operating system and requisite software ready to run on a selected virtualization platform. With a simple text definition file and a single command BoxGrinder will build a lean appliance from scratch, convert it to a target format, and deliver it to your chosen infrastructure.

</abstract>
        <description>Virtualization has become almost ubiquitous in modern scalable infrastructures, with traditional dedicated hardware setups being replaced by multi-tenanted virtual environments. This change facilitates many of the beneficial properties of Cloud Computing, key amongst which is the ability to create small, function-specific appliances that enables system components to scale independently.

BoxGrinder addresses the key problem of specifying and building such appliances. It manages complexities such as software installation, dependency resolution and remote service interactions on your behalf. Existing methods can an arduously convoluted, with poor repeatability and performance characteristics; wasting time and resulting in slow and bloated appliances.  Such factors negate many of the motivating factors for embracing Cloud computing, and this is an obstacle that BoxGrinder is specifically designed to overcome. Coherent and simple to specify and run; yet fast to build and easily customized to any desired level of complexity.  

In this session we will cover the basic concepts of BoxGrinder, with discussion of techniques and use-cases that illustrate how best to utilise BoxGrinder's powerful feature-set. Finally, we will work through a live example, from text definition to a running virtual appliance.

        <abstract>Better planning algorithms can help save the environment, reduce costs and improve service quality. All organisations have planning problems, such as employee rostering, task scheduling, vehicle routing or bin packing. Yet, they hardly optimize those problems. Why? Because those problems are &#8220;NP-complete&#8221;: computationally very difficult and humanly impossible to optimize. 

Drools Planner optimizes such planning problems for normal Java programmers.</abstract>
        <description>It implements a series of optimization algorithms which can optimize any planning problem: heuristics and metaheuristics with fancy names such as &#8220;First Fit Decreasing&#8221;, &#8220;Tabu Search&#8221;, &#8220;Simulated Annealing&#8221;, &#8230; The input and output are plain old java beans (POJO&#8217;s), so it&#8217;s easy to integrate with JPA, JDBC, JSF, ... The constraints are expressed as Drools Expert rules, so adding extra constraints is object-orientated and scalable. And it&#8217;s easy to get a Planner project started with the detailed reference manual and many examples. 

In this presentation, Geoffrey De Smet (Drools Planner lead) will explain the nature of planning problems, go through an entire Drools Planner example, show some demo&#8217;s and compare the results of different optimization algorithms.

        <abstract>You're using IaaS to build a large scale, multi-tenant, hosted service. At the end of the day, you're hosting other people's code in some form.

Your environment needs to be dynamic to properly utilize IaaS capabilities and meet user expectations. You need it to stay secure and controlled. Your users need to stay isolated from each other without feeling restricted. You need to control orchestration, workload management and security. You need to orchestrate to respond to changes in scale or failures at the IaaS level. You need workload management to control the resources a single user can consume and how contention is managed. Lastly, you need users to have access to as much as possible so they feel in control without risking your control of the overall system.

This talk will show by example how Red Hat's OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service uses MCollective for orchestration, SELinux for segmentation, Linux Control Groups for workload management and some core operational fundamentals applied to cloud architectures to tackle this challenge.</abstract>

        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>While JBoss AS 7 (Application Server) in itself is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) I would also like to make sure that the building process itself does not rely on anything but FOSS. 
Having a FOSS build process will truly liberate *any* Java project. 

With an overview of JBoss AS  7 the stage will be set for what components need to be FOSSilized.

Fedora, because it is the most passionate advocate of the FOSS build requirement, makes an excellent target OS for the initial prototype. Plus we can draw upon existing manpower and resources (from Fedora and EAP) to execute it.

Some issues encountered:
  Hibernate Core 4 needs Gradle to build
  RESTEasy depends on JAXB Reference Implementation
  JBoss VFS uses Microsoft code (during testing)

Relying on build tools like Maven, Gradle or Ivy can inadvertently lead to issues where (semi-) unknown dependencies creep into the build process (or worse the runtime operation).

If people give *no* thought to building their code FOSS style, making it fully FOSS becomes quite a choir (or even impossible). So if you care about FOSS, make sure your build is also FOSS.
Let's start here, let's start with JBoss AS 7.</abstract>

        <title>JBoss Forge / Arquillian: Two Missing Links in Enterprise Java Development</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track>JBoss.org Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>One common complaint you hear a lot about enterprise Java development is that it is quite a burden to get started. For a newbie, it takes a lot of knowledge and effort to even put the simplest JSF application to work. A second element that bothers a lot of people is that it is very difficult to verify that your enterprise components actually do what they are supposed to do. Even for seasoned enterprise developers integration testing can be a huge challenge.

Luckily two recent additions to the JBoss toolset come to the rescue. Arquillian is a container-oriented testing framework built on TestNG and JUnit. It takes down the barrier of bootstrapping the necessary infrastructure when trying to perform integration tests. It lets you test your components in their real target runtime environment using real enterprise services. Secondly, JBoss Forge is an incremental enhancement tool that lets you take an existing Java project and safely add in new functionality. Whether you want to set up JSF, use persistence or enable integration testing with Arquillian, it all becomes a real breeze.

Attend this session to learn how to take advantage of both these tools. You will see how they can be used to rapidly create, test and deploy enterprise Java applications. I will also show how they can be extended to put them even to greater use. They truly will turn out to be the missing links you have been looking for in enterprise Java Development.</abstract>

        <abstract>In today's cloudy world of highly scalable applications, the database is increasingly the common culprit for most performance and scalability bottlenecks.  NoSQL is often touted as the solution to your data storage woes, but data grids are a very viable alternative as well, providing both a performance boost to those using relational databases in the form of a distributed cache, but also as a primary key/value store.  However, open source is crucial too since such systems often comprise of lots of cheap commodity-hardware nodes.  Proprietary solutions based on per-CPU licensing models may scale in terms of transactions per second, but fail to scale financially.  And this is where Infinispan comes in: the open source in-memory data grid for the JVM.

In this talk, Infinispan founder and project lead Manik Surtani will discuss the role of in-memory data grids in the Java ecosystem, in relation to cloud, PaaS and enterprise software.  Overlaps with NoSQL will also be discussed, as well as an update on JSR 107 and JSR 347, two JSRs that affect distributed caching and data grids.</abstract>

        <abstract>This talk will give a quick intro into the RHQ systems management and monitoring system and then show recent developments like "Dritf", the detection of changes of files and configurations, the REST api for easy access to collected data from other programming languages. Last but not least I want to point out some possible future development - especially in the area of alerting.</abstract>

        <abstract>The jBPM workflow engine and the Drools rule engine and the help you extract your business logic in workflows and rules, so you don&#8217;t need to hard code it in Java.

For example, suppose your application handles mortgage approval and you have a team of business experts at your disposal that can&#8217;t program. What happens if your business experts want to add a workflow action to send a mail upon each mortgage approval above 100 000 &#8364; with an applicant below age 30? How long does it take to hit production? Can the business experts easily read the changes before they hit production?

With Guvnor and the jBPM designer, those business experts can write and edit the workflows and business rules themselves. They can verify them and put them in poduction.</abstract>

        <abstract>Updates from the Intel userland: GL, X, and infrastructure.

Much has changed for the better in Linux graphics in the last few years. The radical changes driver architecture to make compositing possible are
stabilized and mainstream, new desktop environments are popping up regularly making use of these features, and OpenGL is changing from a usually buggy luxury component to a standard working part of Linux.

In this talk, Eric will cover what has been going on in the Intel graphics driver stack to stabilize Linux graphics and catch up to the
capabilities of of the hardware.</abstract>

        <abstract>This talk will cover two topics, input methods and multitouch support. Input methods are a particularly ill-understood, but hugely important, part of the X input system.  Any input more complex than 'this key produces this symbol', such as Compose keys or phonetic input for Asian languages, is handled by client-side support code.  This talk will give an overview of input methods in X, going through the standard protocol as well as some popular implementations, along with some ideas for future work.

Multitouch support is a hugely attractive buzzword for many devices and form factors. Multitouch support claims to allow for intuitive interactions but so far has largely been limited to custom implementations. With the upcoming X Server 1.12 release, we now have generic multitouch support alongside traditional pointer/keyboard input. This talk will explain the fundamental principles, new event types and how the server behaves when multitouch input devices are present.</abstract>

        <abstract>Cairo is the drawing API that is used predominantly by the GTK stack along with Firefox and couple of ports of WebKit. It is designed as a comprehensible page layout API rather than as a high performance interface to the GPU. It is Cairo's job to bridge the gap between an easy-to-use drawing model and efficient rendering. This is not always as easy as it sounds...

The talk will present the origins of Cairo, its successes, some of its failures, and the promising technologies for the future.</abstract>

        <abstract>This talk is about the Linux open-source driver for nVidia GPUs (desktop and laptop). It will start by a recap of the history of this open source driver.

The talk will then continues by detailing the current (and future) state of the following components:
- DRM + ddx: Modesetting &amp; 2D
- Mesa: 3D
- Power Management

Some demonstrations will also be performed such as video decoding and power management.

Finally, this talk will also allow you to interact with many Nouveau developers and ask your questions directly.</abstract>

        <abstract>While everything is pretty much said and done on the x86 graphics front, and all the players have taken their respective positions and stick by it (despite ones best efforts), nothing has been done for the ARM world, even with the massive market penetration the linux and ARM combination currently has.

The Mali is ARM's own GPU that is rapidly gaining traction. The most popular high end android smartphone so far is Samsung's Galaxy S2. The Mali-400 present in the Exynos SoC of the Galaxy S2 has been leader of the benchmarks for quite a bit. Besides the exynos, Mali is present in a rapidly growing number of SoCs, including telechips, allwinner, amlogic, realtek, VIA, ... The OpenGLES2.0 capable (and thus with separate vertex and fragment shaders) Mali is a highly clean design, and, of all the possible ARM GPUs, the perfect candidate for a free software driver.

This talk will explain the rationale behind this project, the methodology used, the current status and the future direction. At the end, the current functionality (which is rapidly growing) will be demoed on both Mali-200 and Mali-400 based hardware. It will kick off a new era for free software graphics driver development.</abstract>

        <abstract>Version 1.12 of the X server is scheduled to be released in early March, shortly after FOSDEM occurs. The talk will cover what has changed since 1.11, including multi-touch support, and a raft of code cleanups to try and bring the server out of the last century.  Beyond 1.12, this presentation will outline further work planned for the Linux desktop. How X and Wayland will work together, the work remaining to support OpenGL 3.0 and beyond within the X environment and further plans to streamline and modernize the code base.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gluon is an open source database schema analysis and entity/relationship mapper that easily integrates into MonoDevelop. Using the MonoDevelop addin you can browse databases, select tables, generate entities (including bulk rename operations) and add the generated C# code to your project with a couple of clicks. If my cats will help with the coding it will probably support schema migration (from inside MonoDevelop) well before the FOSDEM. If they don't help there will be enough to talk anyway (and nice catfur dolls for everybody).

also show you how can be part of that future, by contributing a patch,
filling bugs or writing an extension.

When you develop a major multi-platform desktop application that is
used by millions of people, you sometimes have to do some crazy stuff.
So we&#8217;ll share with you some of those things. Some of them will make

unreasonable, awesome.</abstract>

        <abstract>"IronPython is a member of the relatively new family of dynamic languages running on top of .Net platform, aimed to be a fully compatible implementation of the Python language, and released by Microsoft under the Apache licence, making it one hundred percent free.

The Python platform itself has a big and vibrant community, and stands as one of the best and most used dynamic languages int the FOSS world.  IronPython thus lets the .Net developers try this amazing language -being possible to smoothly invoke it from C# using the new dynamic features implemented as part of the 4.0 version-, and also lets the Python developers try the sweet bits behind the Mono and .Net platforms.

I would be talking about the basics of IronPython, how it related to the standard implementation, how it interacts with C#, how to use the hosting API, and finally would take about a new IronPython addin for MonoDevelop I've been working in."</abstract>

- hardware failures
in order to achieve 100% uptime.
The talk will discuss tools that PostgreSQL provides, like functions and triggers, and how they can be used to deal with schema changes and how to setup streaming replication for fail-over.</abstract>

        <abstract>SQL/MED is the new frontier of PostgreSQL ! 

Since the release of PostgreSQL 9.1, we see lots of Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) coming out, giving you the ability to connect your database with multiple data sources : local files, other RDMS, NoSQL stores, webservices, etc.

The primary language to write a FDW is C. But a recent extension called "Multicorn" makes Foreign Data Wrapper development easy, by allowing the programmer to use the Python programming language.




This talks will :

  * Explain the basics of SQL/MED
  * Give an overview of the various existing Foreign Data Wrappers
  * Show how to code a wrapper in a blink of en eye with multicorn</abstract>

        <abstract>Red Hat Cluster Suite is a robust technology that is used at many areas.

PostgreSQL can be directly used with Red Hat Cluster Suite, in order to create an active-passive clustering environment.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
In this session, we will setup a two-node cluster, learn how to configure it, also talk about some more details.</abstract>

But as it turns out, this is not such an unholy combination; as long as you keep in mind the effects different settings have on both the NFS client and NFS server and the expections PostgreSQL has regarding file operations, one can get away with it.</abstract>

        <title>Using the OpenJDK to investigate covariance in Java</title>

        <track>Free Java Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>The Java type system is unsafe since it allows covariant use of arrays. For example, an array of Bananas can be used where an array of Fruit is expected, given that Banana is a subclass of Fruit. This allows the following unsafe code:

    Banana[] bananas = new Banana[5];
    Fruit[] fruits = bananas;
    fruits[0] = new Apple();  // runtime exception
    bananas[0];  //  Apple?

In the above example, the programmer gets back an Apple where he was expecting Bananas, causing an undesired runtime exception.

We investigate the covariant use of arrays in open source Java programs to see whether programmers use this problematic feature of Java. We make use of the freely available OpenJDK, modifying its Java compiler to disallow covariant use of arrays, thus reporting any such uses as compile errors. We apply this compiler to a code corpus of 106 open source programs, including large and well-known programs such as Eclipse, JUnit and Ant. 

Initial results of our investigation show that covariance is rarely used outside the context of legacy code and Java libraries. This leads us to question its relevance in the Java language.

In our talk, we also discuss solutions to covariance taken by other languages such as Scala and Google Dart, explain our modifications to the OpenJDK Java compiler and report the full results of our study.</abstract>

        <abstract>In 2011 the London Java Community (LJC) stood for, and overwhelmingly
won a seat in the open elections for a seat on the JCP Executive
Committee (JCP EC), enough acronyms yet?  We haven't even started!
It's been a whirlwind trip so far with a great deal learned about
politics, acronyms, the due diligence required on a JSR, flights to
exotic places (Jersey City!?), wrangling over the wording of a
sentence and of course launching some developer lead initiatives.

There have of course been some great successes in moving Free Java
forward such as the JSR-348 which is the start of reforming the JCP
and JSRs towards a truly open and transparent model.  This talk covers
the good works done so far, some anecdotes of what it's like to work
as a developer amongst a mix of technologists and bearucrats and what
we think is left to be done.</abstract>
        <description>What the audience will learn from the talk:

An insight to how the JCP really works and the surprising fact that
Oracle and the other large corporates are generally pushing for a Free
Java.

How can people help out with the project, what feedback are you looking for?

We want people to start supporting the JCP again and working with it
to change it for the better, JSR-348 has proven that steps can be
taken although we recognize there is still a long way to go.</description>

        <abstract>By now, it's become well understood that Java is far from dead, and that rumors of its demise have been greatly exaggerated. The language once written off maintains its truly unique role as the power behind the legacy enterprise applications as well as the foundation for some of the biggest and most influential next generation companies on the web. 

What is less clear, however, is the future of Java the language versus Java the platform.  JVM based languages are proliferating wildly: Scala, Clojure and its brethren are household names, and even established specialized languages like R are being ported to the JVM. What does this mean for the future of Java? Will they carry it forward into the future, or relegate it to the role of lower level component? 

We'll explore this question through a mix of quantitative data derived from sources like GitHub, HackerNews and StackOverflow, as well as qualitative research on technology developments and directions.

        <abstract>Mutability Detector is a lightweight static analysis tool for Java which
allows you to unit test for immutability. Using immutable objects is regarded as
improving readability of your Java code, and greatly simplifying multithreaded
code. However, without language support, it's all to easy to render classes
mutable, and introduce the potential for subtle, hard to detect bugs. Mutability
Detector gives developers a way to write immutable classes, and help keep them
immutable. 
 
  Mutability Detector uses and depends on several free, open-source Java
libraries, such as Objectweb ASM. Also, being able to look at the source of the
JDK, has greatly helped in improving the analysis.
 
 The audience will learn of a simple little utility that may just help them in
their day-to-day development of Java. People can help out in the usual FLOSS way
- using it, reporting bugs, giving feedback (especially the ways in which I
suck).</abstract>

        <abstract>CacioCavallo is an award winning project sponsored by the OpenJDK porters group.

The main project was about refactoring of the graphics stack of OpenJDK to allow of easy porting on various platform.

It&#8217;s the abstract backend behind most ports and it has been used on field by commercial projects for companies in the embedded and automotive market.

During the last year, two new projects have landed in the official Caciocavallo repositories: CacioWeb and Cacio Testing Framework.

The first project allows for easy deployment even on platforms without any Java support (like Apple iPad) and makes extremely easy the deployment even without any Java plugin.

CacioTest aims to make easy the testing of Graphics stack, providing a reliable, unobtrusive way to run UI and graphics related tests.</abstract>

        <abstract>We are recently witnesses of continuous performance improvements both in hardware and software worlds. However for systems with millions requests and users, performance is still very important. One of not that obvious performance optimizations is Garbage Collection selection and tuning. Garbage Collectors save us a lot of time and shield us from low level memory problems.

However to take full advantage of Garbage Collection, we need to make the exploration process easy. Visualizing the Garbage Collection techniques (visualizing events, understanding memory abstraction and fragmentation, history observation) is critical for mentioned performance tuning, lowering the memory allocation, consumption and GC pauses.

This talk will introduce Garbage Collection in nutshell, but especially abstractions and terms defined in GCSpy project and summarize the porting process of GCSpy to NetBeans platform. We will look at advantages of NetBeans platform, summarize faced challenges and current status of the project and further ideas.

I am looking for ideas to improve the GC visualization even more, other VM support (at least partial) and architecture overview.</abstract>

        <abstract>One area in which proprietary JDK releases have traditionally showed superiority over OpenJDK is in monitoring and instrumentation tools.  We aim to overcome this shortcoming and even reverse the trend by introducing a new, scalable tool to the the ecosystem: Thermostat.  During the last half year, we've been quietly coming up with a plan for how this tool should work, and we're now ready to share what we've come up with.  By working with others in the open Java community, we believe that we can make the most useful, most comprehensive, and all around best application of its kind.

In our presentation, we will describe our extensible model for collecting JVM and system monitoring data side by side.  Attendees will learn about the features we have planned, see a short demo of what is already working, and hopefully be inspired to join us in in making this awesome tool a reality.

        <abstract>The Hotspot/OpenJDK Java agent capability and its associated java.lang.instrument API provide support for runtime bytecode transformation, either initially at class load time or, since JDK6, retrospectively after classes have been loaded and instantiated. This API has been adopted as a de facto standard by several other industrial strength JVMs. The uses of this API extend far beyond simple code instrumentation and suggest that more widespread adoption of the OpenJDK Java agent model and use of Java agents is highly desirable.

Byteman is a Java agent program and suite of associated tools which supports tracing, monitoring and testing of Java applications via bytecode transformation. This has many advantages over conventional approaches, in particular being much more flexible and far less invasive. This talk will demonstrate Byteman in action showing you how to install and run it both standalone from the java command line and integrated with the JUnit and TestNG test frameworks driven from ant or maven. The examples progress from injecting simple debug trace to displaying a timing bug in a multi-threaded application.

Along the way you should learn how Java agent programs work and how much freedom they have to manipulate the JVM runtime. I hope to encourage many of you to use Byteman and to contribute suggestions for new features. Also, maybe a few of you will be inspired to implement your own agent programs or to provide support for agents in other JVMs.

        <abstract>Open Source Software has long enjoyed the ability to be trivially acquired, installed and maintained on Linux via packages, where each package contains within it all the information required to find and configure the necessary dependencies.
    
However, in many situations there is a strong need to install OSS on Windows,where traditional package management systems like RPM and DPKG are not only unavailable--but couldn't support the platform in a manner consistent with the other software.

This presentation looks into the technical details of CoApp, a new fully-open source package management system fills this gap by providing all the tools to easily create, publish, discover, and install software packages, including automatically handling dependencies, managing updates and providing a frictionless end-user experience, all in a method that is well supported by the platform.

        <abstract>Caching has been a 'hot' topic for a few years. But caching takes more than merely taking data and putting it in a cache : the right caching techniques can improve performance and reduce load significantly. But we'll also look at some major pitfalls, showing that caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as ways to deploy them in an efficient way, this talk is for you. In this talk, we'll start from a Zend Framework (PHP) based site. We'll add caching, begin to add servers and replace the standard LAMP stack, all while performing live benchmarks.</abstract>

The coreboot developers are proud to present the first working mainstream laptop here at FOSDEM.

This talk will briefly introduce coreboot goals and current project status, and then jump right into a rollercoaster ride through laptop architecture (main processor and embedded controllers), x86 early initialization, coreboot architecture, reverse engineering, hardware debugging, and how to write coreboot support for a laptop. You'll get to know the various technical (no debug hardware available, ...) and non-technical (no datasheets, ...) roadblocks and how to overcome them.
Whether you just want to understand how coreboot works and buy supported hardware or you want to port and install coreboot to your own hardware, this talk will give you all the info to get started.</description>

        <track>System Track</track>
        <type>lecture</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>We stumbled upon ancient (circa 1960) scrolls of wisdom in the field of statistics and applied it to modern day monitoring systems. The result is a monitoring system that detects anomalies instead of relying on statically defined thresholds as well as predicts failures long before they become problems.</abstract>
        <description>There are many, many things wrong with the typical, free monitoring solutions available today.

 * They rely on probing rather than look at actual data generated by real users of the monitored system/service.
 * Their definition of a failure is simply some value exceeding a statically defined threshold.
 * They don't tell you something is wrong until it's too late.

In this talk, I'll present an alternative.
 * It prefers passive monitoring to gather data about the experience real users have with the system/service,
 * It detects any anomaly. Unexpected low values can be indicative of problems, too!
 * It uses various statistical methods to predict problems before they occur. It's easy to imagine a file system that fills up another 5% every month and it's easy to predict how full it'll be in 5 months. It's more complicated (but certainly doable!) to make an automatically computed, educated guess as to whether you'll be able to handle the annual spike in demand on your webshop this holiday season based on the load over the preceding months.</description>

        <title>Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with LLVM </title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track>Development Track</track>
        <type>lecture</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Any sufficiently complex application eventually evolves its own scripting framework or domain-specific language.  These can be simple things, like a graphical scripting language for connecting pre-existing building blocks together, a domain-specific language for performing image convolutions, or a general-purpose language like a Lisp or JavaScript dialect for writing extensions.

These are usually implemented as ad-hoc interpreters, which limits their utility things that are not performance critical.  With LLVM, it is very easy to turn a quick-and-dirty interpreter into a high-speed JIT or static compiler.  This talk will explain how to plug LLVM into your application and allow code in your scripting language to run (almost) as fast as compiled C.

LLVM is a set of libraries that can be assembled to build compilers and related tools.  This talk will give a close look at some of the APIs, the core abstractions that they present, and how they are used.</abstract>
        <description>LLVM is probably best known for the clang front end, which allows it to work as a drop-in replacement for gcc when compiling C-family languages.  This use hides much of the power of LLVM.  It is not a monolithic compiler, but a set of libraries that can be assembled to build a static compiler, a JIT compiler, or a variety of other things.  


Most complex applications include some kind of scripting capability.  These come in a variety of forms.  Some include simple macro languages that allow the user to automate repetitive tasks.  Some, such as EMACS and Firefox, include such powerful scripting environments that a significant fraction of the application ends up being written using them, making scripting performance very important.  Graphical applications may embed a domain-specific language for things like image convolutions, which would benefit from being compiled down to SIMD instructions for the user's CPU.

Embedding LLVM in other applications is a relatively easy way of providing any of these.  It is relatively easy to adapt an existing interpreter to use LLVM as a JIT compiler, or to write a new language front end and leave all of the code generation to LLVM.  If you write a JIT compiler that uses LLVM, then it is trivial to extend it to provide static compilation, so anything written in your scripting language and embedded in the application can be compiled to native code ahead of time and linked into the binary, just like C code.

This talk will give a quick overview of the semantics of the LLVM intermediate representation and cover the main classes that a front end would need to use to generate it.  It will draw on the experience from writing &#201;toil&#233;'s Smalltalk implementation, which uses the same underlying object model as Objective-C, to provide suggestions for closely integrating scripted and native code, as well as mechanisms for adding profile-driven optimisations that are specific to a given language.</description>

        <abstract>Apache Cassandra is a distributed database built to handle massive amounts of
data on large clusters of community servers. This talk will present the
storage engine at the core of Cassandra, motivating the use of a structure
akin to a Log-Structured Merge Tree rather than of a usual B-Tree and it's
implications for the data model. We will also introduce most of the current
features of that engine (secondary indexes, integrated caching, TTL...)
including recent developments introduced in Cassandra 1.0 like
compression/checksumming and the new leveled compaction.</abstract>

        <abstract>If you are a developer interested on the DevOps movement, you can implement end-to-end development-to-production process taking advantage of Apache Maven and Puppet, to automate continuous delivery, from source code to any number of application servers managed with Puppet.
</abstract>
        <description>The DevOps movement aims to improve communication between developers and operations teams to solve critical issues such as fear of change and risky deployments. But the same way that Agile development would likely fail without continuous integration tools, the DevOps principles need tools to make them real, and provide the automation required to actually be implemented.
Most of the so called DevOps tools focus on the operations side, and there should be more than that, the automation must cover the full process, Dev to QA to Ops and be as automated and agile as possible. Tools in each part of the workflow have evolved in their own silos, and with the support of their own target teams. But a true DevOps mentality requires a seamless process from the start of development to the end in production deployments and maintenance, and for a process to be successful there must be tools that take the burden out of humans.

Apache Maven has arguably been the most successful tool for development, project standardization and automation introduced in the last years. On the operations side we have open source tools like Puppet or Chef that are becoming increasingly popular to automate infrastructure maintenance and server provisioning.

In this presentation we will introduce an end-to-end development-to-production process that will take advantage of Maven and Puppet, each of them at their strong points, and open source tools to automate the handover between them, automating continuous build and deployment, continuous delivery, from source code to any number of application servers managed with Puppet, running either in physical hardware or the cloud, handling new continuous integration builds and releases automatically through several stages and environments such as development, QA, and production.</description>

        <abstract>Many open source hackers see the allure of building applications that integrate with the telephone network.  However layers of industry jargon, proprietary technology and arcane knowledge lead many to believe that telephony is "hard."  Adhearsion will change their minds.  The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first of its kind in the open source world.  In this talk we will build several working voice applications and demonstrate how to integrate them with external services.  Along the way, we will discuss voice application design and show how to avoid common pitfalls.</abstract>
        <description>The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first of its kind in the open source world.  By utilizing modern a modern, powerful and descriptive programming language, Ruby, and development practices like test-driven-development, Adhearsion allows developers to apply tools and skills they already have to this rich domain.  During this talk, we will build and demonstrate several working voice applications:

* Getting started: setting up your first app
* Getting connected: demonstrate the ways to get calls into your app
* Getting integrated: pulling data from outside sources
* Getting sophisticated: mixing in text-to-speech and speech recognition to your app
* Getting to scale: Techniques and patterns to make your voice app scale

The demos will cover ways to deploy apps on a pure open-source stack with Asterisk as well as to the cloud by using service providers like Tropo.</description>

        <abstract>"Internet of Threads" gives a new perspective on the Internet. Each process, group of processes or even a single thread can be an Internet node, having its own ip address, QoS, routing etc. Virtual Distributed Ethernet, User mode IP stacks, partial virtual machines can make this change possible.</abstract>
        <description>What does a network connect? The question about which are the real nodes of a network has been the target much recent discussion in the research community. In the beginning Internet and the TCP/IP protocols were based on the idea to connect computers, hence, the addressable entities were the networking adapters.

This seminar introduces an alternative view: a process or a group of processes can be made to correspond to a single networking node. This concept has been named Internet of Threads.

This proposal is already supported by a set of software tools which are an experimentalproof-of-concept for this change of outlook on networking.

The international research lab on virtuality named VirtualSquare developed several tools:

   &#183; VDE: the Virtual Distributed Ethernet. It supports the definition of virtual LANS interconnecting user Virtual Machines (and other virtual entities) both running on the same host and on remote hosts.

   &#183; LWIPv6: a hybrid stack IPv6, back compatible with IPv4, and implemented by a modular library. A program using LWIPv6 can join a TCP-IP network using its own IP addresses, routing, etc. LWIPv6 supports address autoconfiguration, DHCP server, DHCP client, NAT and slirp (including IPv6 NAT and slirp).

   &#183; View-OS/umnet/umnetlwipv6: View-OS implements partial virtual machines, i.e. it grants the possibility of virtualizing only some features of the hosting environment. For example the module named umfuse supports the virtual mount operation of file systems, umdev supports the definition of virtual devices. Umnet furthermore supports virtual networking stacks, and its submodule umnetlwipv6 uses LWIPv6 to define multiple TCP-IP stacks. By View-OS, standard tools like web browsers, ssh servers or clients can use virtual networks, e.g. a VPN, while other processes running on the same host are under different network definitions (e.g. the kernel provided TCP-IP stack which uses the physical networking adapters installed).

This change of view permits great flexibility in terms of service migration: a virtual distributed ethernet network defines a cloud in which the programs (our threads) are directly connected as they were nodes of a LAN. When joining a VDE, the physical
location of the server thread which provides a service is irrelevant: that virtual address can be everywhere on the virtual network.

Within Internet of Threads, the idea of running a unique stack per host, or at least a unique one per container, become obsolete. The stack is merely a library which implements the layers of a protocol stack. This library can run as kernel code or as user
level code, depending on the performance requirements of the system. The fundamental change is that each user can run several networking stacks for her applications (processes or threads) and she can decide which virtual (or real) network is connected to each stack and which IP addresses, routing, QoS apply.

The model includes also gateway applications working with several networking stacks at the same time. Unfortunately, the Berkeley sockets API was designed with the implicit assumption of a single netwokring stack available. We designed an extension to the API in order to fix this lack by providing the support of serveral stacks. This extension allows the support of useful features like:

   &#183; The simultaneous support of several stacks for different usage scenarios: different retransmission policies, different sizes for the TCP packet windows etc.

   &#183; The support of a production stack together with an experimental stack. It is common to have one single stack implementation, including when several stack instances are running in the system (e.g. virtual adapters for containers). Through the idea of Internet of Threads it is possible to use a reliable stack for the normal use and in the meanwhile to control the experimental environment provided by a second stack, maybe still unreliable and under investigation.

        <abstract>The Unpredictability of UNIX I/O (and how we might tame it)</abstract>
        <description>Inter-process communication and remote procedure call facilities have existed in operating systems for many decades. Ever since the first parallel applications ran on time-sharing machines, programmers have sought
ways to communicate between processes running on a single machine, and the first networked applications introduced the concept of sending a message to trigger a remote action. 

And today, these primitives are more relevant than ever before: parallel programming on clusters of machines relies heavily on facilities to pass data between processes and hosts. On a higher level, data-flow frameworks for parallel processing of large data sets (such as Hadoop or CIEL) depend on passing data between different tasks, which may run anywhere, including local to a machine, on a networked cluster, or far away in a virtualised wide-area "cloud".

And yet, we are stuck with UNIX communication APIs closely coupled to the underlying mechanisms used to implement them: the programmer choice of sockets, pipes or shared memory constitutes an implicit choice of a whole set of assumptions about the relative locations of the communicating parties, as well as how the message is to be delivered. Worse even, the implicit trade-offs may not be the same in a different environment, and thus the programmer's choice of API depends on assumptions about the runtime environment (hardware, software and setup) in addition to the characteristics inherent to a mechanism implied.

This talk will firstly discuss the impossibility of using current APIs efficiently (via benchmarks on a diverse set of hardware (from many-core AMDs to the experimental Intel SCC). Finally, I will describe our work on introducing a hierarchical name system and extended socket API that adds support for automatic transport selection and reconfigurable sockets. This permits many NUMA-related optimisations on single hosts, for VMs to switch to shared memory communication if on the same physical host, and for seamless network-wide protocol upgrades to multi path TCP or TCPcrypt.</description>

        <title>A strategy for managing diverse equipment in the CERN controls group</title>

        <abstract>The CERN accelerator control systems access equipment distributed over a
geographic area tens of kilometers across.  

When off the shelf hardware is not available engineers design and prototype I/O
devices as needed. With the advent of the open hardware repository, 
collaborations between the physics laboratories, research institutes and 
industry now ensure high quality designs and generality. The manufacture of
these devices may be tendered out to industry and the companies involved are
free to add them to their own catalogs.   

The control system requires very precise timing and synchronization of control
and acquisition values over a large area and a diverse array of configurable
equipment connected to the accelerators. Great care is required to manage the
control system timing and configuration so that remote FPGA cores are set up 
correctly.

The &#8220;White-Rabbit&#8221; timing project is open and addresses the future timing
and synchronization needs for CERN and other laboratories. White-rabbit makes
use of synchronous Ethernet and uses ideas from IEEE 1588 PTP protocol to 
synchronize remote equipment up to 10Km apart to better than one nanosecond.   

Various control system devices at different geographic locations will have on
board FPGA logic loaded dynamically by carrier FMC device drivers with 
configuration data. Device specific drivers then scan the FPGA configuration
via a Wishbone-standard bus to determine the installation and if any further 
configuration is needed.   

Etherbone is a software extension of the Wishbone hardware standard permitting
remote FPGA cores to communicate with each other and with other control system
components.

The variety of I/O peripherals, their wide range of activation mode
and the requirement to move several megabytes of data per channel per
second is managed by ZIO, a new I/O framework designed to handle
the usual I/O channels but also pulse generation and sampling; all
peripherals may also be white-rabbit-aware, so that their own
timestamps are more precise than what the host computer can offer.
Although ZIO examples drive simple I/O channels, the system is able
to DMA directly to user space, to sustain high data rates.

        <description>Indeed, it has been quite difficult for her to enter the community. Difficult, but not impossible! And now, she simply loves FLOSS. So she'd like to explain how Mozillians managed to catch her attention. And which kind of contributions geeks can propose to "normal people" to attract them, and to keep them in the community...
You'll see that Average Jane or Joe can be useful ;-)

She thinks geeks need Average Jane or Joe to understand what the public really wants or needs. It's the only way to really open up the Web!

So throughout this talk, she will explain what you can do to attract "normal people".</description>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Based on his experiences with aggressively growing and maintaining the Exherbo community Bryan dives into the secrets and experience leading to this success.

Exherbo averages 5 new contributors every month despite being a small and relatively unknown project. The contributors stay quite active within the project and stay with the project for years.

Bryan drives straight into the heart of his community management techniques and explains how you can easily achieve a similar success for your project, be it open source or a otherwise peer driven project. He'll also turn it on it's head and explain how users can benefit from the exact same techniques to get faster and much better responses when dealing with developers. And how to get the upper hand when dealing with the system administrators at the office..

Secrets revealed includes:
* why you should only be looking for inexperienced developers
* why you should openly apply social engineering techniques when dealing with developers
* what makes inexperienced developers such a big asset for Exherbo
* how users can manipulate developers into fixing their bugs and many more.

        <description>Research shows that most OSS projects are done by very small teams. What happens when, instead of having two developers, you have an entire team working on something? What motivates them, and how can you add to that as a community rather then detract from it?

Beginning with early 2000s theories about the motivation of open-source developers, I'll move into more complex motivation theories and the complexities of adding paid developers to an open-source project, and how that affects a project's community.</description>

        <abstract>XQuery has been designed by the W3C as a general purpose XML processing language.
Although XQuery is mainly known as a query language for XML collections, it is a fully fledged programming language useful in a variety of architectures and environments.
With an extremely powerful support for database queries, scripting, and full-text search, XQuery is providing a unified framework for building web applications.
The aim of this talk is to briefly introduce some of the new language features in XQuery 3.0 and demo how XQuery &amp; HTML5 can work together to build applications that are 300% awesome.</abstract>

        <abstract>LibrePlan is a collaborative tool for planning, monitoring and control of different types of projects. LibrePlan is a project management tool based on Gantt diagrams. It is also a web-application. Thanks to its rich web interface, LibrePlan provides an user experience similar to desktop applications like MS Project.</abstract>
        <description>When planning a project, it's very common to find yourself managing different resources working in different projects at the same time. LibrePlan was designed from the very beginning to deal with scenarios like this, where resources and projects have a high degree of connection. This requirement makes LibrePlan a little bit different to other existing tools.

LibrePlan is not an isolated island. It's usual that input data needed by LibrePlan may be stored in other systems. In that case, LibrePlan can be fed with these data, thanks to its web services import capabilities. On the other hand, LibrePlan can feed other applications if necessary or even communicate with other LibrePlan instances.

LibrePlan is a free software application licensed under the AGPL. One of the great assets of LibrePlan is its open development process, always driven by the LibrePlan community. The LibrePlan community engages companies and individuals working together hand by hand to build the best free software project management tool.

If are keen to know more about LibrePlan, if you are a developer and would like to collaborate with the LibrePlan community or if you are a company and would like to start using LibrePlan for planning your project, please come to see us and learn more why LibrePlan is important for you.</description>

        <abstract>Topics: partitioning of large calculations, computation networks, python, celery, rabbitmq, redis</abstract>
        <description>The open source OpenQuake seismic calculation engine (http://openquake.org/) is developed and maintained by the GEM foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) which is a public-private partnership that drives a collaborative effort aimed at developing and deploying tools and resources for earthquake risk assessment worldwide.

Seismic hazard calculations can be massive making it necessary to partition and distribute them across a compute network. The OpenQuake engine (http://openquake.org/) partitions seismic calculation and uses

  - celery
  - rabbitmq
  - redis

to push the tasks into the compute network and to collect the results.

There were a number of lessons learned while scaling up OpenQuake to perform seismic calculation for the whole of Europe and I will touch upon the most important ones.</description>

The mission of EPFSUG is to
* Assist people interested in using free software in the European Parliament
* Drive adoption of free software in the European Parliament's information infrastructure
* Push for use of open standards, to ensure equal access for citizens using free software
* Work in cooperation with like-minded groups in Europe and around the world

This Lightning Talk will make you want to become a supporter too, because everybody needs a hacker to talk to sometimes, in particular the folks who work in the European Parliament!</abstract>
        <description>The first public announcement of the European Parliament Free Software User Group (EPFSUG) on 6 February 2010 was made at FOSDEM. Now one year later EPFSUG wants to come back and tell the world what happened, what we do now, and what our plans are.

We currently constitute 1 patron, 11 members and 25 supporters. We have a website, some mailing lists and a pad.

EPFSUG is a user group, but it's complicated. Most members have standard EP office workstations with very little free software running. At the same time, most of EPFSUG's supporters are hackers and overall very proficient free software users.

We try to bridge the gap application by application. Our first project for opening up the possibility to use free software in the European Parliament is tmail - a server workaround to let you use your mail with IMAP - and with it new simple ways to have basic email privacy. Our second application is the browser. So far not much has happened in practice on the EP office workstations, but we have at least initiated a dialogue with the EP folks who really decide, and it looks like Firefox will soon be available on the standard EP office workstation. The third big project will of course be word processing, but we have not worked so much on that yet.

We also come together to talk about free software in society at large (ie. the world outside the EP) so we have had meetings on FreedomBox, ParlTrack, Ubuntu Unity and CiviCRM. The most ambitious presentation so far was probably a hacker perspective on reverse engineering the law making process...

EPFSUG could grow much more. We want to come to FOSDEM again for the same reason as last year - "The EU Parliament needs your help" - but this time we'll maybe have a stand with t-shirts and stickers, and a looong to-do-list with stuff to hack :-)</description>

        <abstract>The GNU FM software allows music lovers to share their listening habits and to discover new music. It allows artists to find new audiences for their music and to earn a little money.

Libre.fm is a public installation of GNU FM which anyone can make use of, and which currently has roughly 50,000 users and over 80,000 streamable tracks by 7,500 artists. By letting Libre.fm know what music you like and dislike it's able to construct personalised radio streams filled with great freely licensed music tailored specifically to your tastes.

In this talk we'll discuss what we've achieved so far, our plans for the future and how you can help out.</abstract>
        <description>GNU FM implements the Last.fm protocols, making it an easy drop-in replacement for clients that already support the submission of listening statistics to Last.fm, and for clients capable of playing Last.fm radio streams. A number of players have already added out of the box support for Libre.fm, including the GNOME music player Rhythmbox.</description>

        <abstract>Geeklog is a web content management system. The project has been around for more than 10 years now and is probably best known for powering the Groklaw website.</abstract>
        <description>Yet another CMS? Actually, Geeklog has been around for longer than many of the other systems, yet has kept a low profile. Originally written for a security portal, security has always been our focus - to the extent of refusing certain features as long as they can not be implemented in a way that we consider secure.

The lightning talk will provide a quick overview of Geeklog, its features, focus, and community.</description>

        <abstract>What is Semantic MediaWiki, what can it do for me, and why is it not on Wikipedia yet?</abstract>
        <description>Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) is a free, open-source extension to MediaWiki &#8211; the wiki software that powers Wikipedia &#8211; that lets you store and query data within the wiki's pages.

Semantic MediaWiki is also a full-fledged framework, in conjunction with many spinoff extensions, that can turn a wiki into a powerful and flexible &#8220;collaborative database&#8221;. All data created within SMW can easily be published via the Semantic Web, allowing other systems to use this data seamlessly.</description>

        <subtitle>separating web apps from data storage &#8211; truly free web software</subtitle>
        <track>Lightning Talks</track>
        <type>lightning</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>Unhosted is a non-profit project defining a standard to separate web applications from data storage. 

The web apps are pure client-side Javascript, fully inspectable and thus enable truly free software on the web. It also allows app developers to enter the web market a lot faster by not needing to care for any data storage. At the same time, users have their data in one place and can use all the apps with just one account and data storage.</abstract>
        <description>Usually, web applications always come with storage attached to it. You can not choose where an app stores the files you use, it&#8217;s just their server. Put plainly: You get their app, they get your data. We want to improve the web infrastructure by separating web applications from your data.

You have one remote storage where your data and user account resides. In apps, you identify with your user address which then connects to your remote storage and loads your data locally in the app &#8211; nothing leaking to the app server. This makes it easier for users because they only need one account and place to have their data &#8211; a "My Documents" for the web.

App developers don&#8217;t need to bother about storing user data or scaling their applications &#8211; because it all runs in the user&#8217;s web browser. The applications can be Javascript apps using localStorage, like many web apps already. Just include the remoteStorage.js library and search/replace localStorage with remoteStorage &#8211; and the app enables people to use their own remote storage for it.

To act as a remote storage, a platform needs to provide WebFinger for discovery, OAuth for authorization and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for cross-domain AJAX calls: ownCloud is already compatible and we work on making CouchDB, Wordpress and Google Drive compatible.</description>

        <abstract>USB redirection is using USB devices attached to a real machine inside a virtual machine (guest).
The focus of the talk will be the special case where the USB device being redirected is not attached
to the physical machine hosting the virtual machine, but to some other machine. The talk will present
and discuss the ongoing work to create an FOSS solution for this, getting this merged into upstream
qemu, as well is integrating this into Spice and the Spice-client.

The intended audience are people who are interested in usb in virtual machines (vusb) both
developers and users. The audience is expected to be familiar with generic virtualization concepts,
but no deep technical knowledge is required.</abstract>
        <description>The purposes of this talk are:
* To inform people about the new USB redirection support in qemu and Spice
* Get feedback for future versions
* Hopefully get people to use Spice and maybe even become contributors

I gave the same talk last year, but quite a few things have changed:
* USB-2.0 support
* Integrated into Spice</description>

        <abstract>Existing virtualization solutions such as Xen, QEMU and usermode operating systems virtualize the entire OS.  While this is useful in a machine room type of use case, it is unnecessarily heavyweight when the interest is in virtualizing only one kernel driver or one kernel service.

This talk introduces the anykernel architecture and rump kernels, which allow to safely virtualize individual drivers and subsystems from a monolithic kernel. Rump kernels can be used in a variety of different configurations, such as an application library, a microkernel style server, or as a server over the Internet.

We will go over a number of real world use cases and present results which show that in their application domain rump kernels are faster, smaller and more agile than full OS virtualization technologies.</abstract>
        <description>The implementation is available in production quality code as part of NetBSD.  A key point of the project is the use of existing drivers from a real OS, i.e. real-world hardened code.</description>

        <abstract>There are tons of virtualization projects based on tracing: user-mode linux, umview/kmview, fakeroot-ng, cde.
Ptrace is ugly and old but fundamentals tools rely on it: gdb, strace. New tracing facilities like uprobes, lttng and systemtap have been designed mainly (only) for debugging, not for virtualization. In the meanwhile there are new efforts to create more flexible kernels: anykernels and millikernels. These new approaches need a specific support: hooks, hypercall or tracing. It does not matter how we call it. Utrace is (was) an option, with some minor effort at kernel level, even classic ptrace could be implemented at user level for back compatibility.
The workshop wants to be a technologically agnostic discussion on tracing supports for virtualization and for new flexible kernels.
All contributors of new ideas are welcome to the open discussion.</abstract>

        <abstract>The libvirt library provides a hypervisor agnostic API for interacting with &amp; managing virtualization hosts. Traditional uses of virtualization have focused on running entire operating systems in virtual machines or containers. The libvirt-sandbox library builds on libvirt, LXC &amp; KVM, providing an API which facilitates the use of virtualization as a tool for building secure application sandboxes, without the additional burden of maintaining additional OS installations.</abstract>

        <abstract>Recent developments in the Xen community mean that installing and configuring a Xen host has never been easier. However Xen remains both powerful and complex which can prevent a barrier to those wishing to deploy Xen.

In this panel discussion we will briefly present recent user facing changes to the way in which Xen is deployed (e.g. xend to xl toolstack migration, Project Kronos, pvops Linux kernel domain 0 support).

The bulk of the session will be an opportunity for users to describe problems which they are having deploying Xen and discuss the solution and possible future directions with a panel of Xen developers.</abstract>

        <track>Embedded Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>eLuaBrain is an experiment in educational computers with a number of
unique features. It is a low cost, completely autonomous computer
designed to work with low cost peripherals (PS/2 keyboard on input and
a standard VGA monitor on output). Its main goal is to offer another
perspective on education in general and training IT professionals in
particular. Modern computers are difficult to understand at the
hardware level even for experienced IT professionals; at the same
time, there is a growing trend in most modern computer languages to
completely ignore the hardware on which they run and focus entirely on
programming concepts instead. By contrast, eLuaBrain offers the whole
experience in a single package. Its hardware is easy to understand
(and hack) and the on-board software offers easy ways to interact with
the hardware, thanks to the features provided by the eLua open source
project. eLua is built around the programming language Lua, which is a
relatively compact language, but comes packed with lots of features,
which makes it very suitable for teaching programming concepts. With
eLuaBrain it is natural to teach programming and hardware design in
parallel, which gives students a complete image on the
hardware-software interactions.

At the hardware level, it is built around a 32-bit CPU (a Cortex-M3
core) with 1M of external RAM. It also features TCP/IP network
connectivity, SD card storage and a low power radio link. eLua brings
a MCU-friendly Lua interpreter and hardware support modules into the
equation, while the built-in code editor and on-line help system make
eLuaBrain a truly autonomous platform. A very low footprint, UDP based
remote file system can be used to easily share files with any desktop
machine.

The hardware and software behind eLuaBrain are open source, free to
use for both commercial and non-commercial projects. eLuaBrain comes
with a number of sample applications meant to demonstrate the platform
features and to serve as a starting point for future applications.
These include a RSS reader, an IRC client, a Web server and (of
course) games.

This presentation will start with an overview of eLua, after which
we'll take a deeper look at the implementation of eLuaBrain at both
hardware and software level and its future directions of development.
If time allows and the right hardware is in place, a live demo of the
platform will also be provided.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aseba is an open-source project providing a set of tools that
allow beginners to program robots easily and efficiently.
Technically speaking, Aseba is an event-based architecture for
distributed control of mobile robots. It targets single- or
multi-processor robots and simulations. The core of Aseba is a
lightweight virtual machine tiny enough to run on
microcontrollers. With Aseba, we program robots in a
octave-style scripting language using an integrated development
environment. This environment provides several features
important for robotics, such as real-time inspection of
sensor/actuator data, integrating plotting, on-typing
compilation, distributed debugging, and instant code upload to
the robot. Compared to alternatives (for instance Arduino and
Lego Mindstorm), Aseba focuses on text-based programming but
takes advantage of the tight integration between the environment
and the robot to provide an interactive robot programming
experience.

Aseba stems from research in miniature mobile robotics, in which
small robots with multiple microcontrollers have risen
architectural questions (see papers under links). In addition,
Aseba has found a natural application in educational robotics
with the Thymio low-cost robot. We have also demonstrated Aseba
in simulation and on a group of e-puck robots. Aseba integrates
with D-Bus and ROS, allowing access to microcontrollers from
high-level languages.

I am the initiator and maintainer of the Aseba technology and
one of the most active contributors. I propose to present a talk
with the following content:
 * Genesis, why did we develop such a thing.
 * Technical overview, with discussion of the design choices.
 * Presentation of the Aseba in the robotic-research context.
 * Live demonstration of Aseba in the educational context using
  the Thymio robot.
 * Future directions.
 * Conclusion and question answering.

I started developing Aseba as part of my PhD work in the Mobots
research group at EPFL. Currently, a community comprising
members of the Mobots group, of the mobsya association, of the
ASL at ETH Z&#252;rich and other individuals maintain and further
develop Aseba.</abstract>

        <abstract>After deploying an embedded system, it is desirable to be able to upgrade the firmware, in order to add new features or to solve bugs. However, it is often difficult and expensive for a technician to get physical access to the device(s). Therefore, it should be possible to perform the upgrade remotely, which also means that it should be secure and survive any kind of failure. In the course of their career the consultants at Essensium/Mind have encountered many failure paths and solutions of how to deal with them. This includes issues like bad firmware, power failure, communication problems, security issues, flash corruption and bootloader bugs. Solutions include fall-back firmware, watchdogs, journalling filesystems, backup media and package managers. But in the end, it turns out that there is no silver bullet and that the best upgrade approach mostly depends on how the system is used.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Qt framework is best known by most developers as a graphical
toolkit library, which allows to build graphical interfaces with
windows, buttons, checkboxes and drop-down lists.

However, Qt is not limited to graphical application development and
through this talk, we would like to highlight the multiple features
that Qt offers to embedded Linux developers developping non-graphical
applications.

Based on the experience of a real non-graphical application developped
for a customer, we will detail how Qt has helped integrating features
such as communication with multiple devices over serial ports,
communication with a GSM modem, XML parsing, HTTP requests,
communication with Linux input devices, and more.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries is a UI toolkit designed for
the embeded world in mind. We have now released version 1.1 after
almost one year of work. This new version come with new features, a
lot of speed and memory improvement, improved portability (we
officially support Windows now) and no API or ABI break. It is a proof
of the will of Enlightenment team to provide a reliable base for any
serious work. We are now working on preparing a release for another
set of important libraries and also finishing the last few items in
the Enlightenment DR 17 todo list. With Tizen project and the growing
contribution of Samsung, 2012 is going to be a very interesting year
for the Enlightenment project and we will talk about just that.</abstract>

        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>PMH is a home automation system built from the ground up to be easy to use, modular and as open as possible. Our software and hardware are completely open source, with source code, schematics and CAD files available online. PMH consists of 3 layers. The hardware layer, the &#252;berdust layer and the apps.

In the hardware layer, we use a wireless sensor network with sensor nodes and actuators that communicate with each other using the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 protocol and with a computer that acts as the main controller. The wireless sensor network consists mostly of Arduino nodes which control lighting, heating/air conditioning and electrical devices while at the same time using sensors to measure things like power consumption, temperature, light, movement, air quality etc.

&#220;berdust is responsible to bridge the other two layers by capturing and saving the data from the WSN to a central database, and provide easy to use interfaces (i.e. REST, Web Sockets) to the application layer. This way, applications can get sensor values from the wireless sensor nodes, and control the nodes accordingly.

In the application layer, we have developed a web and smartphone application that gives users the ability to remotely control the system, view the current status of the various sensors and set automated behaviors such as turning on the lights when there are people in the room, sending a notification to the user's smartphone when someone enters your room, turning on the water boiler on predefined times, etc.

Last but not least, due to the modular and open source nature of our system, its easy to add additional data providers in the hardware layer, such as an arduino with additional sensors, or even your computer and smartphone (i.e. your smartphone's accelerometer, the status of your server). It's just as easy to develop your own apps using our APIs, and extend the capabilities of the system to meet your own needs (remote controlled BBQ anyone?)</abstract>

        <abstract>Is your Android code easy to write, to read and to maintain?
AndroidAnnotations is an Open Source Android framework that aims at simplifying your Android developments, without performance cost.
AndroidAnnotations helps you build Android Applications faster because it allows you to focus on your business problem rather than the plumbing code that connects components and systems. 
Simply put, AndroidAnnotations generates the boring boilerplate code of your application at compile time, using the Java 6 Annotation Processing API.
The presentation will start by explaining the key concepts, followed by a live coding of a simple Android application, to demonstrate AndroidAnnotations' advantages.</abstract>

        <abstract>Several distribution projects have existing initiatives and programs in order to coordinate and/or fund local communities as well as shipping or producing promotional material, going to events to promote the project, etc...
Some projects are currently looking into setting up something like this, and others are rethinking their current model.
Those programs all have their differences, but achieve pretty similar goals.

In this session, we will bring together a bunch of people from different projects who are in charge or actively participating in such initiatives, in order to briefly present what they are currently doing in their project and, more importantly, share experience about what has worked well and what hasn't in an open discussion session.
Let's learn from each others' ideas and mistakes.

        <abstract>More and more distributions are porting their software to run on ARM CPUs. This is a session for people working on or otherwise interested in those ports to share progress reports, problems and ideas.

Steve will start the discussion with the current status of the two ARM ports in Debian ("armel" and "armhf"), but is not planning on spending the whole session on that!

        <abstract>Debian is usually advertised as a volunteer project with a subtle mix of democracy and do-ocracy. While this is correct, implementation details are mostly undocumented, and it is often difficult for prospective or relatively new contributors to really understand the inner workings of the project.

This talk will detail some useful lessons, and also some secrets about Debian learned over the years. It is hoped that it will be helpful to people willing to get things done in Debian.

        <abstract>I have just finished redesigning the Debtags website, consolidating a 9 years long history of bringing categories to a large and complex distribution like Debian.

There is more to Debtags than meets the eye: interesting library science concepts, anonymous submissions, an efficient review workflow, a fully automated tagging engine, dynamically generated tagging hints, fancy tag search algorithms.

On top of that, there is not much that is Debian-specific in the new codebase, so if you are interested in implementing categories on your distribution of choice, this could give you quite a head start.</abstract>

        <abstract>For many years, syslog-ng was part of many distributions but stuck at ancient software versions. My task was to help distributions to update their syslog-ng packages and now to keep them updated. This is a two way process, as while distros receive many help, we also get a lot of useful feedback and ideas, which influence the development of syslog-ng.
Using syslog-ng as an example, I'll try to show how upstream can work with distributions for the benefit of both sides.

        <abstract>Presenting tools and workflows used via Open Build Service by various distributions to develop the distribution. This includes automated source processing, validation, QA, automated and manual reviews.

Additional focus point on maintenance handling, means updates after a distribution is released which are usually done in a complete different way.

I like to have a discussion about the question how distributions should validate trustable sources and how the trust can be increased by a common distro effort.

        <abstract>A reliable and transparent, high volume package review infrastructure was implemented with the [Open Build Service (OBS)](http://openbuildservice.org/). In OBS, a software package can travel through several projects. Submission Review is done at project specific gates to control such travel.
The openSUSE:Factory project currently defines review gates for license compliance, security and packaging. Together with an issue tracking system we create a community friendly ecosystem that implements project policies. Centralized gatekeepers or dedicated review periods are eliminated. Propagation delay is minimized.
With OBS providing the hooks to add review authorities, we were able to code most of the respective business logic with python scripts, reusing and extending the osc command line tool as a feature-rich layer ontop of the OBS API.
This talk describes the openSUSE project review process and how it helps various stakeholders to excercise their control, using the legal team as a non-trivial example.

        <type></type>

        <abstract>In GNOME, accessibility is a core value that touches all aspects of
the system. [1]

From the infrastructure, to the graphical toolkit, to the
applications, to the assistive technologies, accessibility has been a
central consideration from the very early days.

On April 2011 GNOME 3.0 was released, and although GNOME and the
accessibility made a huge effort, the accessibility support was not
ideal. But not are bad news. Finally the accessibility technologies
are starting to be used from the two main free desktops. AT-SPI is
starting to be used on KDE distros, and Orca is starting to be
functional with Qt apps. Since GNOME 3.0 a big effort was done in
order to improve the situation. At the moment of this proposal writing
an ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest is being organized, in order to fix the issues
from the framework itself.

The purpose of this presentation is explaining:
  * Introduce accessibility on GNOME.
  * Briefly explain the status towards GNOME 3.4
  * Summarize the output of the ATK/AT-SPI2 hackfest
  * Compare GNOME 3.0 vs GNOME 3.4
  * KDE status and cooperation
  * Future

        <abstract>Wayland is a next generation display manager that is hopefully the
future for graphics in the Free Desktop. It provides an opportunity to
avoid some of the historical baggage associated with X - and enable
smoother and more flexible user experiences.

In this talk i'll show of the status quo of various toolkits running
on Wayland - including GTK+, Clutter, Mx and with a special guest
appearance from Tiago Vignatti to show off the state of the QT port.

We'll talk about what works and what doesn't and what application
level programmers need to think about when porting their application
to run under Wayland. In particular input is a field where X has
lagged behind current technology - Tiago will show how the exemplary
input architecture in Wayland can be exploited to create compelling
modern user experiences.</abstract>

remote systems, such as virtual machines or remote desktop. A local
machine is powered by KVM &amp; Spice, and you can access remote desktop
via libvirt, SPICE and VNC (and more coming). Boxes is made for you,
developers, contributors, and users of application running on other systems.
During this talk we will demo latest version and describe the design of
Boxes. We will discuss the importance of Boxes as part of the
GNOME project. Finally, a list of missing features and the roadmap
for the next cycle will be presented.</abstract>

        <abstract>Amarok is the old fart among the Free Desktop music players by now.
Newfangled software with "social" and "distributed" in their summeries
has come and taken some of the buzz from our old wolf.
But Amarok is still kicking! The recently released version 2.5 is
better then ever and even comes officially supported on Windows. But a
project is one foot in the grave if it does not have plans for the
future. Come gather around the warm buzzing projector kids, to hear
the story of Amarok's future on small pocketable devices and large
clumsy desktops.

        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>We can't get anywhere with free software if the developers don't do
design. They always did. It just sucked because they went with whatever
the first iteration was. The focal point changed and "we'll add some UI
later" is not design. Interaction with the software is key. 

Design requires you to have a general idea about the interaction
upfront, but not everything. Once a general idea is out there an agreed
upon, the second part of the design process kicks in.

"Prototyping"

Prototypes help you see the flaws of a design more clearly, and missing
features can be added to accelerate the design/development of the
project. Frequent and agile iterations between visual designing &amp;
prototyping is part of a healthy design process.

Since developers can write code they can also prototype, (as long as
they don't get attached to their code).

This talk is about how designers tricked a developer to be one of
them...</abstract>

and work done in the last months since last desktop summit. A
lot of things have happened in these months, we will summarize
the various WebKitGTK+ improvements in rendering (accelerated
compositing), accessibility, networking, etc. Also we will cover
WebKit2 architecture and initial version of the API, we will detail
the roadmap for WebKit2 support for WebKitGTK+. And or course some
nice demos :).

        <abstract>A typical recent version of a MySQL-based product focuses on letting you run the same queries on more CPU cores, or having better replication. MariaDB 5.3 is very different: its focus is the new query optimizer features that let you run queries that were traditionally considered off-limits for MySQL.</abstract>
        <description>MariaDB 5.3 is getting stable: 5.3.3 Release Candidate has been released in December, and one can expect another, almost? stable release in January or February.

This talk will show: - What kinds of traditionally no-no queries are now okay to run, - What optimizations are used to execute them, - How the new optimizations behave for typical kinds queries and popular

    benchmark suites. 

In conclusion, we will discuss relationship with other MySQL branches: which of these new optimizations will also be in MySQL 5.6, what are the differences between MySQL and MariaDB variants, and what one can expect to see in Percona server.</description>

        <abstract>Tired of the intricacies of circular replication? Dreaming of real multiple masters solutions for MySQL replication? Dream no more. Tungsten Replicator, a free and open source replacement for MySQL replication, can build clusters of asynchronous nodes in a matter of minutes. This workshop will explain the basics of Tungsten Replicator, and it will show how to start your multiple master cluster in a few minutes. There will be examples of several topologies: from the simplest bi-directional replication to the ambitious all-to-all (every node is a master), fan-in (multiple masters to a single slave), the star (a central hub connected to several bi-directional masters)</abstract>

        <abstract>Much is discussed regarding query optimisers within database server, attention is not always paid however to the actual queries that are passed to a database server to execute and the value of those queries within an application context.

No matter how good a query optimiser is it can not match the performance improvement that can be gained by not running a particular query at all, retrieving smaller result sets or running queries less frequently.

We will discuss some methods to investigate the SQL your application is sending to your MySQL server, and examine some techniques to visualise the cost of the interactions your application has with the MySQL database.</abstract>

        <abstract>Problem: you want to test many different builds of MySQL. There is a proliferation of MySQL versions and builds. Working as a DBA or as a consultant, you will find large installations of MySQL 5.0 to 5.5, with subtle variations among them. In the same company there may several versions of MySQL 5.1, or you may find a mix of vanilla MySQL and Percona or MariaDB builds. For all these version, you often need to reproduce a problem using the same version being used in production, and often you need to install several test servers in the same host for this purpose. Then there are the work-in-progress versions that Oracle and other companies are producing. And you want to test them before adopting them. For all the above needs, there is MySQL Sandbox, a versatile tool that allows you to install multiple servers in the same host, no matter if they are the same version or different ones. This workshop will explain quickly how MySQL Sandbox works, and then show with practical examples how to test several combinations of servers in a single host quickly and painlessly. It will also show examples of how to use MySQL Sandbox to solve practical administration tasks, such as re-playing binary logs or producing a filtered binlog.</abstract>

        <description>3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the new standard for high speed data
communications, an evolution of the 3GPP-family of standards (GSM,
UMTS...), but adopted also by CDMA networks as the next 4G technology.

ModemManager is a project running under the freedesktop.org umbrella,
which works with NetworkManager in order to provide easy setup of
broadband mobile connections in Linux-based systems. The new 0.6 release
of ModemManager will be able to handle mixed CDMA/LTE and GSM/UMTS/LTE
devices.

This talk will provide an overview of the new LTE and LTE advanced
technologies, from both network and device points of view; present the
new features arriving with this technology; and describe what is being
done in ModemManager to be able to manage 4G devices.</description>

        <description>The evolution of cloud computing has given birth to new incredibly successful applications. Cloud based voice and media services can create similar opportunities and add tremendous value to existing web applications. Traditionally voice and media services require capabilities that are well beyond the scope of typical IT department, but Telecom engineers are no longer needed to make enticing value-added services. Any web developer can make telecom apps in minutes and integrate them with Web 2.0 and social networks. This session will explore how this can be made possible through the use of RestComm for adding voice and text to current cloud-based applications and services and explain how RestComm is backed by a powerful and autoscalable PaaS based on Mobicents.

        <abstract>By using the sip:provider Community Edition, an open source VoIP soft-switch
leveraging powerful and widely used open source components, we will in 15
minutes create a VoIP deployment from scratch in order to provide future-proof
voice and video communication services, preceded by an introduction into the
system architecture.</abstract>
        <description>There are various open source components (e.g. Kamailio, Asterisk, Freeswitch
and Sems) available to build a reasonably sized VoIP service from scratch.
There are also some administrative web interfaces (e.g.  Webmin, Siremis),
allowing you to control the most basic things in such a system. And in order to
escape the lab stage, you can even put an open source billing engine (e.g.
a2billing) into the mix. Since your customers would like to manage their
accounts and features, you will then develop a customer self-care interface as
well.  Time to market: at least two months. Feature set: basic. Service
quality: uncertain at best. Future-proof: not.

There is a solution to that though. During this talk, I will present how to
deploy a solid VoIP Provider platform from scratch in just a few minutes, using
the Sipwise sip:provider CE (SPCE) v2.4. The SPCE is a free and open source
soft-switch based on Kamailio, Sems and Asterisk, providing fully featured and
seamlessly integrated administrative and customer-self-care web interfaces,
SOAP/XMLRPC provisioning APIs, a flexible rating engine and a huge load of
subscriber features like conferencing, voicemail, call forwards, block lists
etc. On reasonable hardware, the SPCE can serve 50k subscribers and more.

As an introduction, I will outline the basic elements involved in a VoIP
deployment. Then I will dive into the architecture of the SPCE, showing the
building blocks and their interaction. Finally, I am going to do a live
presentation on how to configure an SPCE instance for a typical deployment.</description>

        <abstract>The SIP Express Media Server can be used to provide SBC-like functionality in various ways, and this presentation will demonstrate two of them.</abstract>
        <description>SEMS, the SIP Express Media Server, is the media and application server counterpart to SIP Express Router aka Kamailio/OpenSER, the leading open source SIP Signalling server from iptel.org. Since 2004 SEMS has been used to implement classical value added services in VoIP networks like announcements, conferencing, voicemail and RBT, and converged services as web conferencing and voice message broadcasting.

More recently, its integrated Back-to-Back User Agent has been extended and improved for flexibility and high performance, making it one of the few open source solutions for high volume session border control. But there's more to it: Thanks to its flexibility, it can also be used as core call routing element, and be a useful tool in various situations for the VoIP platform engineer.

The talk will present the SEMS SBC functionality and typical performance numbers, and then show how developers can use the internal call control API to create custom call routing in the SBC with two examples: Using a RESTful interface, a web app server implemented with the Play! framework is used for user controlled call routing, and by accessing a blacklist database in REDIS, SEMS' SBC can be used to block SPIT. </description>

        <abstract>Demonstration of building applications with the Adhearsion voice application development framework.</abstract>
        <description>Many open source hackers see the allure of building applications that integrate with the
telephone network. However layers of industry jargon, proprietary technology and arcane
knowledge lead many to believe that telephony is "hard." Adhearsion will change their minds.
The Adhearsion project is an open source voice application development framework, the first
of its kind in the open source world. In this talk we will build several working voice applications
and demonstrate how to integrate them with existing PBX installations. Along the way, we will
discuss voice application design and show how to avoid common pitfalls.

        <abstract>The University of Strasbourg has built a 'Skype replacement' for ~60,000 users using open source standards and software.</abstract>
        <description>A few years ago the French Ministry of Education and Research, issued a memo that strongly advised against use of Skype in universities and research centers. Security and excessive bandwidth consumption were among the main concerns.

In practice however, the directive has been rarely applied for one major reason: (perceived) lack of alternatives.

Therefore, in the beginning of 2011, the University of Strasbourg has started an effort that aims to propose an actual Skype alternative to both its faculty and students (~60 000 users). The project started with a number of extensions added to the Jitsi project in order to add support for features such as GTalk interoperability for example.

It then continued with a deployment of the actual network using exclusively FLOSS projects such as Openfire, Jinglenodes, FreeSWITCH/Asterisk, TurnServer and others.

The talk will also cover aspects such as NAT traversal with ICE and JingleNodes, redundancy, security and confidentiality.</description>

        <abstract>With SIP networks being used for more than just Voice/Video calls, it has become important that the SIP infrastructure provide secure signaling channels; this talk will present features of Kamailio and how they can be used to provide this security.</abstract>
        <description>Besides quick update of what is new lately in Kamailio SIP Server project, the presentation will focus on showing how to use Kamailio to build a secure communication platform for SIP. Kamailio features a scalable SIP routing engine for dispatching of Voice/Video calls and Instant Messages as well as rich SIMPLE presence server for user availability states with embedded XCAP server for management of privacy rules and buddy list. With IM and Presence traffic being carried via signaling channel, encrypting SIP channel is the only way of ensuring confidentiality and protection of data exchanged. Today, Kamailio offers asynchronous TLS communication layer, tested and improved over last years for robustness and cope with the demands of telecom-grade deployments. </description>

        <abstract>SIP can be used for much more than 'plain phone calls', and this talk will demonstrate chat, file transfer, contact lists and more!</abstract>
        <description>PSTN emulation and audio calls are by far the most used applications for VoIP and SIP these days. As our communication needs grow we are in need for new means of communication, however. Why use the phone to do VoIP, email to send files and jabber to have a chat channel in the context is a single conversation? We can merge those 3 communication channels within the same call with SIP today. 

In order to find the perfect moment for the conversation presence may be used and policies for presence together with our own contact list may be stored in a remote server and synced with all of our devices.

All this can be done today, with SIP, in a standard way and with Open Source tools.</description>

        <abstract>This presentation will walk the audience through the design principles of an isometric role playing game engine. The specimen to be dissected is an actively developed yet fully playable game called FreedroidRPG. A general presentation of the game will be made, before the architecture of its engine is exposed. Examples of good and bad design decisions will be provided, and the way to pull out of ugly situations without compromising stability explained. The game covers most of its objectives but some open questions remain which will be exposed to the audience.</abstract>

        <abstract>Game architectures used to be designed in an inheritance-based approach, which has proven to be difficult. The current state-of-the-art is a component-based architecture that allows loading all game entities from a separate data source. This enables easier testing and modularization of the code.
It is also beneficial for the game designer as it weakens the game designer's dependency on the programmer. This is important for content creators of open-source games, so they can easily add their new content to the game, without relying on somebody else to help them.
This talk will outline the reasons to use a data-driven and component-based architecture, give examples of architectures used in popular open-source games (Wesnoth, MegaGlest, 0AD and Unknown Horizons) and explain how Unknown Horizons moved from an inheritance-based approach to the new component-based architecture.</abstract>

        <abstract>The WorldForge Project was founded in 1998 on many dreams of online world with freedom, both in terms of price and from the constraints of proprietary software.
Pulled in many different directions by often conflicting visions of what the perfect online role playing game should be, the developers have been forced to come up with novel solutions allowing unprecedented flexibility to both the game designer and the player. Using data driven and procedural technologies, systems have been developed that remove the need for gigabytes of patches that are associated with proprietary commercial titles, and allow every host to configure their own game rules in a unique world.
In this talk one of the projects longest standing programs will describe some of these technologies, including the possibilities they unlock and examples of their use.</abstract>

        <abstract>Building computer games is fast becoming big business, not just for the big companies, but also for the little companies. To join this vibrant world, we need tools: Ways of easily constructing the games, modern and effective distribution methods, ways of getting the users' feedback and so on.
Enter the GamingFreedom.org project, whose open platform empowers everybody to create and distribute games. This talk will shortly explain the ideas behind GamingFreedom.org, and present the Gluon framework for creating games, and the GamingFreedom.org network for makers and players of games.
Finally: A live, on-stage demo!</abstract>

        <abstract>Developers comfortable with Moose typically look back on their first projects and cringe at some of the more naive choices made simply because they were unaware of better ways. Learn to avoid some common pitfalls and save time with knowing: when to use delegation and when to use role composition, common MooseX namespaced modules that simplify implementation, native attribute traits, and designing with an eye toward Inversion of Control.</abstract>

        <abstract>Interchange is an Open Source e-commerce software written before the advent of any modern Perl. Thus we implemented a lot of things like running a server, dispatching, parameter parsing, session handling and templating. We decided to reduce the source code drastically by using modules from CPAN like Dancer, PSGI and Template::Flute instead of our own custom code.</abstract>
        <description>Interchange will become a collection of a few base modules providing an API for carts, payment, shipping and access control which can be extended easily with plugins. This provides you with a solid, fast, simple and flexible platform for your online business based on modern Perl, which is going to be demonstrated during the presentation.</description>

        <abstract>Deploying from Git `git-deploy`, a tool to make rollouts and reverts easy, and the sort of development culture at Booking.com required to use the tool effectively, such as the the role of monitoring and testing.
</abstract>
        <description>Booking.com has recently open-sourced its internal development tool, git-deploy. Since its internal introduction in 2008 it has allowed developers and web designers to put code live in a simple and easy procedure, enabling them to roll code out into production within seconds of it being pushed to the master repository.

This talk covers the rollout framework, the tool itself and its internal workings, including per-subsystem tag creation and ability to stage changes before rollout and rapidly roll back, create hot fixes, automated rollout emails, change tracking, rollout history etc. We will also discuss the necessary development culture required to use the tool effectively, such as the the role of monitoring and testing.</description>

        <description>The agent is responsible for executing various tasks implemented as plugins, such as local inventory, network discovery, software execution, etc. Its design, resulting from the aggregation of multiple unrelated pieces of software, was quite... baroque.

        <description>We deal with issues such as:

* We cannot flush the cache, so we need an upgrade path for new object versions.
* We wanted to isolate some changes that are normaly global settings.

In this talk Marius will describe how they use Moose with Memcached and show how they used the standard Moose/MOP tools to extend MooseX::Storage to support their needs.</description>

        <title>Apache Giraph: distributed graph processing in the cloud</title>

        <abstract>Web and online social graphs have been rapidly growing in size and scale during the past decade. In 2008, Google estimated that the number of web pages reached over a trillion. Online social networking and email sites, including Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, have hundreds of millions of users and are expected to grow much more in the future. Processing these graphs plays a big role in relevant and personalized information for users, such as results from a search engine or news in an online social networking site.

The Apache Giraph [1] project is a fault-tolerant in-memory distributed graph processing system which runs on top of a standard Hadoop [2] cluster and is capable of running any standard Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) operation over any large generic data set which can be represented as a graph. Apache Giraph is a loose implementation of Google Pregel but can be added to any Hadoop job pipeline as a normal MapReduce job. Giraph entered the ASF Incubator in July 2011, where it has enlisted the aid of committers from Yahoo!, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

The talk will describe why running iterative MapReduce jobs for graph processing is not well suited for typical MapReduce jobs, introducing the reason why Google designed Pregel at first place. Next, the BSP model and how it is applied to graph processing will be explained. The last part of the talk will be dedicated to Apache Giraph, with a description of the programming model (i.e. the API, some typical examples such as PageRank and Single Source Shortest Path) along with a technical overview of how the architecture of Giraph works and how it leverages the Hadoop infrastructure.</abstract>

        <language></language>
        <abstract>Graphs are becoming increasingly popular as ways of modeling a wide variety of systems. As such, the label "graph processing" also covers a range of objectives and architectural constraints.
At [Linkfluence][http://us.linkfluence.net/], we use graph processing on datasets produced with very different systems (Web crawler, Twitter and Facebook API, feed aggregator, etc.) We spend a lot of time doing exploratory programming, trying to use our eclectic datasets in interesting ways, and processing our data in asynchronous workflows.

We have come to see [Hadoop][http://hadoop.apache.org/] and the processing framework [Cascalog][https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog] as essential tools in our toolbox when dealing with graphs, since it gives us architectural flexibility, scalability and the possibility of rapid prototyping.

Cascalog is an open source framework built on top of Hadoop and [Cascading][http://www.cascading.org/]. Its syntactic and semantic roots come from Datalog and Prolog, which have been succesfully applied for a long time in the manipulation of graphs. Also, its ability to directly embed the expressive [Clojure][http://clojure.org/] language allows to very easily define
custom operations and ad-hoc processing.

In this talk, we will present the framework, consider its advantages and drawbacks when compared to other approaches, show concrete exemples of usage for graph processing and how we use them to complement graph databases.</abstract>

Thanks to the awesome A-Team, the organisers of this room aim to have a Birds of a feather, with the following agenda, but totally open to contributions.

- State of the art.
- Things that can, or have, to be improved.
- Future trends on Graph Processing.

Take the chance to attend if interested on Graph Processing, or if you are working and contributing to the community! I am sure this discussion can give all of us great ides to work on!

See you there!

        <abstract>You can find more information about it in my blog article: http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/graphity-an-efficient-graph-model-for-retrieving-the-top-k-news-feeds-for-users-in-social-networks/ 
and a demo can be found at http://gwt.metalcon.de/GWT-Modelling/#Home 

A key challenge of web platforms like social networking sites and services for news feed aggregation is the efficient and targeted distribution of new content items to the users. This can be formulated as the problem of retrieving the top-k news items out of the d-degree ego network of each given user, where the set of all users producing feeds is of size n, with n &#8811; d &#8811; k and typically k &lt; 20. Existing approaches employ either expensive join operations on global indices or suffer from high redundancy through denormalization. This makes retrieving of different top-k news item sets for thousands of users per second very inefficient in a large network. 
In this paper, we propose a novel index GRAPHITY to remedy this problem. The GRAPHITY index is based on neo4j and allows retrieval of the top-k news items from a user&#8217;s ego network independent of the node degree of his ego network, thus reducing join efforts. In addition to efficient top-k retrieval, GRAPHITY does not introduce any redundancies in the content data.We prove that updates of the index are in O(1) and adding a new content item is linear in the user&#8217;s indegree. We compare the theoretical run time complexity of GRAPHITY against several baselines on two data sets of different characteristics and size. Our evaluation confirms that GRAPHITY is independent of the node degree d and network size n. In addition, GRAPHITY significantly outperforms the baselines in retrieving the news feeds as our theoretical examination predicted.</abstract>

        <abstract>Ontological Conjunctive Query Answering knows today a renewed interest in knowledge systems that allow for expressive inferences. Most notably in the Semantic Web domain, this problem is known as Ontology-Based Data Access. The problem consists in, given a knowledge base with some factual knowledge (very often a relational database) and universal knowledge (ontology), to check if there is an answer to a conjunctive query in the knowledge base. This problem has been successfully studied in the past, however the emergence of large and semi-structured knowledge bases and the increasing interest on non-relational databases have slightly changed its nature. 

This presentation will highlight the following aspects. First, we introduce the problem and the manner we have chosen to address it. We then discuss how the size of the knowledge base impacts our approach. In a second time, we introduce the ALASKA platform, a framework for performing knowledge representation &amp; reasoning operations over heterogeneously stored data. Finally we present preliminary results obtained by comparing efficiency of existing storage systems when storing knowledge bases of different sizes on disk and future implications. </abstract>

        <abstract>We are recently witnesses of the significant movement and adoption of NoSQL databases. In particular, the 
graph databases become an important technology as we deal with a high increase of relational data. 
They not only store graph data structures much more efficiently, but also provide powerful graph traversal 
capabilities that make them suitable for this kind of data. 

However we need to ease the exploration and understanding of these large amount of data. Visualizing the graph 
structure (relationships between nodes and edges) is critical to many situations like: verifying the reliability of new 
data input, optimizing an architecture based on the shape of the data, and even creating new services based on facts 
discovered in the data. 

In this talk, you will learn how to understand the graph structure easily using Gephi &amp; Neo4j! 

We will go through the installation and showcase of visualization capabilities of Neo4j graph database 
in Gephi. The talk will cover exploration of general useful features of Gephi applying them on imported Neo4j 
database.</abstract>

        <title>Challenges in the Design of a Graph Database Benchmark </title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track>Graph Processing Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>Graph databases are one of the leading drivers in the emerging, highly heterogeneous landscape of database management systems for non-relational data management and processing. The recent interest and success of graph databases arises mainly from the growing interest in social media analysis and the exploration and mining of relationships in social media data. However, with a graph-based model as a very flexible underlying data model, a graph database can serve a large variety of scenarios from different domains such as travel planning, supply chain management and package routing.</abstract>
        <description>During the past months, many vendors have designed and implemented solutions to satisfy the need to efficiently store, manage and query graph data. However, the solutions are very diverse in terms of the supported graph data model, supported query languages, and APIs. With a growing number of vendors offering graph processing and graph management functionality, there is also an increased need to compare the solutions on a functional level as well as on a performance level with the help of benchmarks. 
Graph database benchmarking is a challenging task. Already existing graph database benchmarks are limited in their functionality and portability to different graph-based data models and different application domains. Existing benchmarks and the supported workloads are typically based on a proprietary query language and on a specific graph-based data model derived from the mathematical notion of a graph. The variety and lack of standardization with respect to the logical representation of graph data and the retrieval of graph data make it hard to define a portable graph database benchmark. 
In this talk, we present a proposal and design guideline for a graph database benchmark. Typically, a database benchmark consists of a synthetically generated data set of varying size and varying characteristics and a workload driver. In order to generate graph data sets, we present parameters from graph theory, which influence the characteristics of the generated graph data set. Following, the workload driver issues a set of queries against a well-defined interface of the graph database and gathers relevant performance numbers. We propose a set of performance measures to determine the response time behavior on different workloads and also initial suggestions for typical workloads in graph data scenarios. 
Our main objective of this session is to open the discussion on graph database benchmarking. We believe that there is a need for a common understanding of different workloads for graph processing from different domains and the definition of a common subset of core graph functionality in order to provide a general-purpose graph database benchmark. We encourage vendors to participate and to contribute with their domain-dependent knowledge and to define a graph database benchmark proposal.</description>

        <abstract>Amber is an implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language that runs on
top of the JavaScript runtime. Amber brings client side scripting to
the next level. Imagine developing directly in an IDE in your web
browser: write unit tests, debug, inspect, save and run your code
without hitting the refresh button.

In this session, we will:

   - Show how to get started with Amber
   - Show how the JavaScript integration works
   - Show examples of how to access and quickly wrap existing JavaScript libraries (e.g. Google Maps, Ace editor)
   - Discuss how Amber can be easily incorporated into existing webapplications - regardless of the back-end (Ruby, PHP, Seaside, etc) and how it can co-exist with existing client-side JavaScript
   - Show some nice applications written in Amber</abstract>

        <abstract>      Spoon? 
Spoon! It's a minimal object programming system derived from Squeak, with new approaches to organization, collaboration, and deployment. 

Spoon is the system I want for writing and distributing software. Initially, it has only that needed for a new programmer to start and extend it easily. This includes a module system, with which any Spoon system may provide code and data to others. Each module is a live object, and coordinates the direct synchronization of providing and consuming systems. 

The very smallest object memory snapshot I've made is 1,337 bytes long. An interesting intermediate result of this work has been "session imprinting", the transfer of compiled methods directly from one system to another as a side-effect of running them, without needing to compile source code.

        <abstract>Linker, compiler, runtime linker and the kernel can be improved to start applications significantly faster.</abstract>
        <description>Optimizing application startup is hard, even measuring how long an application takes to start is a non-trivial problem.

This talk will consist of 3 main parts:
1. Ways of measuring IO patterns [on startup] using systemtap, gdb, valgrind
2. How to optimize IO patterns on startup given the limitations in existing tools
3. A list of proposed changes in the kernel, ld, ld.so, gcc that could significantly speed up application startup on Linux.

Additionally, the talk will compare application startup on Linux against other major platforms.</description>

        <language></language>
        <abstract>Traditionally Mozilla measured Firefox performance with a set of performance tests called Talos. For features not covered by Talos developers benchmarked individual features themselves.
However, it turns it is extremely difficult to design a representative testsuite. Reproducing performance problems is often harder than fixing them.
Telemetry is a way to measure Firefox performance &amp; usage in the field. It allows developers to insert lightweight probes and then use them to track how Firefox behaves in the wild. We have been using Telemetry to improve Firefox since version 7. We will soon roll out Telemetry to addon developers so they can benefit from the same infrastructure. This talk will cover how Telemetry is used and the kinds of problems it helped us fix so far.</abstract>

        <description>Mozilla needs to have a clear, data-driven understanding of what using Firefox is like for the majority of our users. This allows us to make decisions about where to prioritize development, investigate new or poorly understood problems, and improve the user experience.  The Metrics Data Ping is a new project to address this need.

        <abstract>The NOVA virtualization architecture is comprised of a
microhypervisor and a capability-based multiserver userland with a
specific focus on enabling secure and efficient virtualization using x86
hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x, VT-d, SR-IOV). It does so by
moving almost all of the actual "virtualization" into a per-VM userspace
component that is not in the Trusted Computing Base of other virtual
machines. This talk will give an overview of NOVA's unique execution
model and API with a strong focus on how this enables efficient
execution of a VMM. Specifically, this talk will cover how tasks and
threads are realized in NOVA, how communication between threads works,
how VM exits are handled in NOVA and how this extends to SMP machines.</abstract>

        <abstract>Today's operating systems try to find a balance between seemingly
conflicting goals. Ease of use is traded against security, resource
utilization is traded against resource accountability, and system
complexity is traded against scalability. For example, SELinux is ill
famed as hard to use and consequently remains widely unused. As another
example, isolation kernels minimize the complexity of critical system
software but at the cost of limiting these solutions to static applications.

The Genode OS architecture shows how these apparently inherent conflicts
can be solved by operating-system design.</abstract>
        <description>By combining a recursive
system structure with capability-based security, mandatory access
control becomes easy to deploy. At the same time, the trusted computing
base can be minimized for each application individually such that the
attack surface for security-critical system functions gets reduced by
orders of magnitude compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, a
concept for trading physical resources among processes allows for
dynamic workloads while maintaining quality of service. That is not just
theory - the system is ready for demonstration and its developers are
planning to use it as development environment by the end of 2012.

After a brief introduction of where Genode comes from, the main part of
the talk will be focused on the OS architecture and give a glimpse at
the implementation via live demonstrations. Finally, the talk will
briefly discuss the planned steps towards using Genode as
general-purpose OS.</description>

        <abstract>HelenOS is a general-purpose multiserver operating system written from scratch. It is based on a custom microkernel, SPARTAN, which currently runs on seven different CPU architectures (ARM, IA-32, x86-64, Itanium, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC V9) . Most system services (e.g. device drivers, file systems, networking) are implemented in regular user-space processes which communicate via asynchronous messaging.

First, the talk will briefly introduce the HelenOS project history and community structure. Second, we will briefly talk about the major technical areas and specifics of the system (boot and kernel, IPC mechanisms and naming services, devices and filesystems). This part will be supported by demos of the running system as well as by showing the structure of the source code. Last, we will look at what functionality is already there, what is currently being actively worked on and what are the future plans, which aim toward making the system self-hosting.</abstract>

        <title>The microkernel overhead</title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track>Microkernel OS Devroom</track>
        <type></type>
        <language></language>
        <abstract>Since the famous [Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum&#8211;Torvalds_debate) the general public sticks to the golden rule of thumb: Microkernel systems, while nice and elegant, are just academic toys. Due to the infamous communication overhead and other self-imposed limitations, they are never going to be as useful for the general use (in terms of performance) as the good old monolithic systems.

Since the 1990s many researchers (especially the people around L4) have struggled to lower the overhead using the most extraordinary tricks. Others have tried to apply the microkernel design to mission critical, safety critical and other niche targets, where the benefits of the microkernel design clearly outweights the drawbacks. And other folks spent years creating hybrid systems to get the best (and hopefully not the worst) of the both worlds.

But are the drawbacks of the microkernels fundamental?</abstract>
        <description>The way computers are designed, the way programmers think and the way the IT economy works have changed profoundly over the last 20 years. We no longer try hard to save every single CPU cycle and every single byte of RAM in every single routine. We acknowledge that spending 20 % more on a faster CPU and more RAM to run inteligebly designed software is a better idea than spending 20 % more each year on maintaing software with tons of ugly performance hacks and quirks. Our machines are massively concurrent and we tend to (or are forced to) think more in terms of effective parallel algorithms than just plain sequential throughput.

So perhaps it is time to reconsider the true impact of the microkernel overhead given the present conditions and requirements.

Key topics:

  - Reasons for the microkernel overhead
  - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the overhead
  - Ways to minimize it
  - Ways to live with it
  - Ways to embrace it

        <abstract>One shiny aspect of the Genode OS framework is its diversity with
respect to microkernels and hardware platforms it's running on top of.
Although primarily of interest to clients and users, this property
provides some hidden benefits to the system-developer itself.
This talk is basically an experience report. It will give you an insight
into the benefits and troubles of developing on a diverse biotope, the
strength and weaknesses of the available platforms, how Genode gets
ported to a kernel, and what is basically necessary from the kernel's
perspective to drive Genode. The last point will be illustrated by
introducing recent developments of a hybrid kernel/user API in Genode.</abstract>

        <abstract>Implementing support for device drivers (device driver frameworks) in a microkernel-based/multiserver operating system presents some unique challenges. In this talk we will go through all the important aspects of device drivers in HelenOS, at the hurdles and the ways they can be overcome. We will discuss topics such as:

  - Programmed I/O and DMA in user space
  - Level interrupt handling and interrupt clearing, tasklets
  - Cooperation of user-space drivers and kernel (debugging) drivers
  - DDF and Device Manager - automatic driver start, device enumeration and hot (un)plug
  - Exposing driver services, Location Service - drivers are not created more equal than others, a.k.a Death of the Pseudo Device

        <abstract>Rudder is a new open source tool in the configuration management domain. Its aim is not to reinvent the technical wheel, but to provide a new way to drive our infrastructure.</abstract>
        <description> Specifically aimed at drift assessment, it addresses automation, ongoing verification and repairs, centralizing information and knowledge about your infrastructure, compliance reporting... thus helping to keep drift from nominal behavior low. Built upon a standard CFEngine architecture (and other open source components).

This talk will show how Rudder's approach enables everyone in the IT department to benefit from the advantages of configuration management, without necessarily needing to learn a complex tool, or even get their hands dirty. We'll describe and demonstrate how this is possible, and dive into the technical architecture that makes it work.

In a nutshell, clearly separated tasks permit technical experts to create configuration templates for the tools they know best, thus letting non-experts leverage this power via a modern web interface, such as: architects or security officers who implement policy, junior sysadmins who use and reuse such policies to setup services, and pretty much anyone who digs into real-time compliance reports and error logs.</description>

I will also describe the ways in which developers and sysadmins can get involved in the Matahari ecosystem: by creating agents to provide access to existing APIs through Matahari; by creating their own APIs; by writing their own clients to interact with agents; and by interacting through a command line shell or script.</description>

seem to be distant from the particular CFEngine constructs? </abstract>
        <description>In this talk CFEngine 3 operators will be dissected, analyzed and mapped to the ideas
in the promise theory.

Promise theory is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual,
autonomous actors or agents who publish their intentions to one another
in the form of promises, which is particularly suited for configuration
management in distributed systems. Promise Theory was proposed by Mark
Burgess in 2004, further developed in the following years and
implemented in CFEngine 3.</description>

        <abstract>How the Jenkins project had to grow infrastructure overnight, and how a costly mistake doing things the wrong way forced us to migrate to managing our infrastructure with Puppet.</abstract>
        <description> In early 2011 the Jenkins project became the Jenkins project, leaving
behind an organically grown but Oracle (formerly Sun) operated infrastructure.
An open source project with thousands of users had to grow an infrastructure
practically overnight, initially doing things "the wrong way" by hand crafting
machines. That was until a costly mistake forced us to reconsider and migrate
to managing our infrastructure with Puppet from a publicly available shared Git
repository.

Besides Puppet, the Jenkins project also uses a number of other tools to help
manage access control on GitHub, parts of JIRA, etc, all carrying on the very
transparent and welcoming tradition the project prides itself on.

In this talk I will discuss the ups and downs of switching an established
infrastructure to Puppet, all within the public eye and with volunteer time and
energy.</description>

        <abstract>In this talk, I'll use my unique experience from both the standpoint of a system administrator in a small company as well as a reasonably successful DevOps tool writer to explain how modern tools can be used gradually to transition a business to welcome more DevOps practices without sacrificing stability or productivity and in fact increasing both!</abstract>
        <description>Many still consider and talk about DevOps as an absolute thing: developers and operations are the same thing. Of course, this is not the case. DevOps is a range, where on the far left we have old-style ops (very exclusive) and on the far right we have developers doing all the ops (very inclusive).

The idea of DevOps itself is only possible due to wide variety of tools which have become available: Chef, Puppet, MCollective, Vagrant, Cucumber-Chef etc. Prior to these tools, developers simply couldn't be expected or trusted to hook up a terminal to a production machine and run scripts. But with these tools in hand, the ops team can now setup an environment where we slowly push the bar from extreme exclusivity towards more inclusivity.

In this talk, I'll use my unique experience from both the standpoint of a system administrator in a small company as well as a reasonably successful DevOps tool writer to explain how modern tools can be used gradually to transition a business to welcome more DevOps practices without sacrificing stability or productivity and in fact increasing both!

Specifically I'll talk about:

How metrics and monitoring can make the Ops world more transparent, starting the process of bringing in developers.
How development environments provisioned with production scripts and the ability to test new scripts can allow developers to experiment with Ops.
How building a test infrastructure for testing automation scripts can maintain stability in your organization while allowing people unfamiliar with the ops world to get involved.
The importance of dedicating "office hours" as an ops engineer to teaching developers.
"Who wears the pager?" or transitioning pager duty to other engineers safely by leveraging the above tools.
This talk is based on my experience as:

Engineer on Vagrant which powers many large companies and has helped many companies move towards a more DevOps-friendly attitide. I've seen first-hand how tools can assist this transition.
System administrator and software engineer at Kiip, a small company with around 20 employees. I'm the only engineer with any Ops experience, and I've had to very slowly transition our company towards being more Ops friendly.</description>

        <title>Who Pulls the Strings?  Integrating OpenNMS with Modern Configuration Management</title>

        <abstract>This talk considers the two most common user stories for OpenNMS integration with modern, conventions-centric configuration management platforms.</abstract>
        <description>As organizations of all sizes provision and run servers at larger
scale and in ever more agile ways, the platforms used to monitor and
manage those servers' performance often become a liability.  The
best-known free software tools in this space tend to make compromises
between scalability and ease of automation, while proprietary
platforms are prohibitively expensive and inflexible.  Enter OpenNMS,
the world's first enterprise-grade network management application
platform that is fully free software.  Massive scalability has always
been the principal design goal of OpenNMS, and recent feature
additions including a dynamic provisioning subsystem and ReST API
offer a path for easy integration with modern, conventions-centric
configuration management platforms.  This talk considers the two
commonest user stories for such integration, from concept through
working code.

Organizations already on the DevOps train almost certainly use a
modern configuration management platform, such as Puppet or Chef, to
provision and run their physical servers and cloud machine instances.
 For this use case, it makes sense for the configuration management
platform to act as the &#8220;driver&#8221; for the systems management platform.
To service users in this situation, we will explore what it takes to
build a working integration where OpenNMS automatically takes its
service-assurance and performance-management orders from Puppet.  Of
course, plenty of organizations are still running alongside the train,
just starting to move server provisioning and configuration management
to an automation platform.  Since we want to leave nobody behind, we
will also evaluate the approach of using the work already put into
populating an OpenNMS instance to help bring configuration management
religion to all those lovingly hand-built servers.  The development
part in this talk will show which steps are necessary to create your
own provisioning adapter in OpenNMS. As a practical example we will
show how you can create a Puppet URL handler and a Puppet provisioning
adapter. With this adapter it is possible to pull node information
from a Puppet master into OpenNMS. If you want to have Puppet as your
master database for nodes, we will give examples how is it possible to
use the OpenNMS ReST API to push nodes from a Puppet master into OpenNMS.</description>

        <description>RPM is a well understood and relatively easy packaging format that helps to deploy sets of files in a consistent, reproducible and reversible way. Tools like yum, zypper and apt have enabled admins to install, remove and update complete dependency chains of RPMs and to verify on-system changes to these file sets.

Which seems to be a perfect starting point for doing general configuration management with those tools: larger dependency chains can be pulled in via a simple RPM, configuration files can be delivered inside RPMs, administrators feel right at home and have their toolset for installing, updating and verifying the configuration on the machines, developers can easily contribute to simple packaging.

Part I of this talk describes how (and why) we do this at Immobilienscout24.de and discusses pro and cons of this approach.

Part II builds on this and describes our next generation data center deployment and management tool, YADT.

YADT enables organizations to describe their system landscape in a simple, human readable YAML format. YADT is fully aware of not only dependencies between packages and configs, but also of interservice dependencies. Due to this, YADT makes sure that the systems within your platform are updated, configured and restarted in the correct order. It does this by analyzing service and package dependencies and by grouping dependent systems into "chunks".  Deployment then happens as a sequential wave over those chunks, making sure that the platform stays online during the deployment.

YADT is in the process of being open sourced and is available at

        <abstract>Operating systems distributed under the BSD or other permissive licenses such as the BSD family, Haiku, and Minix share many things in common with other FOSS licensed OSes like Linux, but also face different challenges. These challenges include the need for alternatives to widely used GNU tools and the often surprising discovery of users of our systems.</abstract>
        <description>The BSD Licensed Operating System developers room will gather users and developers from BSD licensed OS projects to discuss their individual projects and ways they can help each other achieve their respective goals. Talks about developments in particular operating systems are welcome as are talks or forums on ways we can work together. We also welcome presentations on foundational technologies which are of interest to developers of BSD licensed operating system and presentations on derivative operating systems such as Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.</description>

        <abstract>Pkgng is a completely new package manager rewritten from scratch. It aims at replacing the old pkg_install. It is developed on top of new libpkg which is the high level library that does all the package management, it brings new features such as safe upgrade, (multi) repository support, integrity checking and more. It has been designed to be extensible while remaining fully compatible with the current FreeBSD ports tree.</abstract>

        <title>Towards a BSD C++11 Stack </title>
        <subtitle></subtitle>
        <track>BSD Devroom</track>
        <type>lecture</type>
        <language>en</language>
        <abstract>FreeBSD 10 is expected to have a completely new C++ stack.  The reasons for this are partly legal and partly technical.  The existing stack is covered by version 2 of the GPL, but newer versions from upstream are GPLv3.  The new C++11 standard means that shipping an old version of the GNU stack is no longer acceptable.  This talk will cover the various parts that were required for replacing this stack, the challenges and missing pieces that needed implementing and the advantages of the new stack.</abstract>
        <description>Most of the Free Software world currently uses the C++ stack provided by the GNU project, including the C++ front end to the GNU Compiler Collection and libstdc++, the GNU implementation of the C++ standard library.  In 2007, these projects switched to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  As a result, newer versions have not been imported into FreeBSD and other projects with similar licensing conditions.  GCC 4.2.1 and the associated libstdc++ release are the most recent that can be shipped with these platforms.

Since this release, a new version of the C++ standard, C++11, has been published.  This includes a number of significant changes to both the language and the standard library.  Some, such as r-value references, allow much more efficient implementation of some fundamental parts of the standard template library and make a significant reworking - if not a complete rewrite - desirable.

These two factors, the license and the need to support the new standard, made it desirable for FreeBSD to switch to a completely new C++ stack.  This includes a variety of components.  At the bottom sits the C++ runtime library, responsible for providing features such as exception handling and run-time type information.  On top of this is the C++ standard library, which provides the classes that the standard mandates.  None of this, of course, would be any use without a C++ compiler.  

This talk will examine each of the components in the new, permissively licensed, C++11 stack, including libcxxrt, libc++, clang / LLVM, and the modifications that were required to FreeBSD to support all of these.  Some of these libraries required writing from scratch, while others required effort to port or integrate.  They all depend on various features that are not specific to C++, some of which already existed and some of which required implementing from scratch.</description>

This talk will cover our efforts so far including our plans to ship FreeBSD 9.0 with clang in the base system. I will cover both our current work to replace GPL licensed components with BSD(ish) licensed components and future or experimental work to incorporate new technologies made possible by LLVM.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Lua scripting language has been designed to be embedded into software written in C to allow for scripting and extending of such software. Lua is popular because it is easy to integrate and the language itself is simple and easy to learn. The compact code size and small memory footprint make it a candidate for embedded use.

Most Lua use cases are to extend end-user software, like e.g. the popular game "World of Warcraft" or the photo editing and archiving software "Adobe Lightroom". In this presentation, however, the author will show how Lua can be used in an operating system kernel. An actual implementation will be presented based on the NetBSD Unix-like open source operating system.</abstract>

        <abstract>pkgsrc is a collection of over 11,000 packages available for a variety of operating systems, developed by the NetBSD project. Since the end of 2010, there is an ongoing effort to port pkgsrc to MirOS BSD, an operating system derived from OpenBSD. This talk gives a short overview over pkgsrc, comparing its usage and features to MirPorts, the older "native" packages system on MirOS. Compared to MirPorts, pkgsrc has many more and newer packages, a more active community of developers and a very responsive security team that identifies and patches vulnerable packages. Some more practical aspects will also be treated: how to get a new platform supported in pkgsrc (both on the technical and on the administrative side) and which are the principal challenges in doing so.</abstract>

        <abstract>pkgin is aimed at being an /apt / yum/ like tool for managing pkgsrc binary packages. Many so-called GNU/Linux distributions provide a convenient way of searching, installing and upgrading software by using binary archives found on "repositories". NetBSD, and more widely, all operating systems relying on pkgsrc have tools like pkg_add and pkg_delete, but those are unable to correctly handle binary upgrades, and sometimes even installation itself.

This is the purpose of /pkgin/, to provide the user a convenient way to handle binary packages, using the same working mechanisms than tools like /apt-get/.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Cassandra distributed database runs on the JVM, which in many ways
is a huge productivity boost. However, the more you care about
performance, the less you can afford to let abstractions like i/o and
memory management exist as black boxes.

This talk will cover how Cassandra has gone beyond the interfaces
provided by the JVM to achieve higher performance in three areas.
First, how Cassandra uses platform-specific features such as
posix_fadvise, munmap, and mlock.  Second, how we tune memory
management to avoid pain points in common garbage collection designs,
including in OpenJDK. Third, how Cassandra uses the JDK's
instrumentation hooks to measure the real size of on-heap structures
and make better decisions about what to keep in memory without
error-prone manual adjustments.

        <abstract>Often when people ask the question "Can I legally do that?", they mean
"Will someone sue me if I do...?". Sadly the answer is that if something
is successful, no matter what and how you did things, at some point
someone will just try and sue, just to see if they can get some part of
the success/money.

This talk will describe some of the copyright, trademark and patent
issues a Free Software hacker dealing with the core java platform may
encounter. And some techniques we as a community can employ to make the
chances of individual hackers being the target of a lawsuit smaller and
how to make it harder for someone to take down one of our core java
platform projects.</abstract>

        <abstract>By any measure, Eclipse has been a very successful open source community, and it has certainly contributed immensely to the worldwide success of Java. It has also been for many years, one of best examples of a vendor-neutral, free Java community.

But there is one thing in particular that sets Eclipse apart: it ALWAYS ships on time. For eight straight years, the Eclipse community has shipped its major release on time to the day. How the heck does that work? This talk will focus on the processes, community interactions, and most importantly, the cultural aspects of Eclipse that makes this possible. The not-so-subliminal message is that OpenJDK would be well served to emulate Eclipse in its predictability.</abstract>

        <abstract>This talk will cover progress with OpenJDK on ARM.  It's
basically a progress report, but with some technical detail
about the changes needed for:

* The new Hard FP ABI.
* ARM 7.

I'll also discuss the issues that arise from the Java Memory Model
(also known as JSR 233.)  The talk will then be in two
halves, one part being very specific to Ed Nevill's ARM Assembler
interpreter and JIT, and the other part will cover the ARM more
generally.

If there's any time left I'll also cover the upcoming ARM8
architecture.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gervill is a MIDI Synthesizer which supports digital instruments like SoundFonts and DLS (Downloadable Sounds). The audio processing  code in the project has many other uses beyond MIDI, for example as a sound effects engine in games. In order to further evolve the project the plan is to seperate the audio processing code from the MIDI engine.

This talk will be about the internal of Gervill audio synthesis, some of the problems in there and how we are going to  improve upon them in mind to make it easer to extend and separate the engine.

At the and of talk there will demostration on how Gervill can be used for real-life peformance by Teun de Lange.

        <abstract>IcedRobot is an attempt to bring the Android API on OpenJDK.

It was first announced at Fosdem 2011, and after only two months of development and a team assembled during the customary Fosdem Free Java Hackers dinner, it was already able to translate most Android bytecode format to Java.

This presentation will review the last year of development and will explain future direction and plans for the project.

        <abstract>If you are using the default Java/Java plug-in on a major Linux distribution,
chances are, you are using IcedTea and IcedTea-Web. This talk will focus on
those projects. It will cover what IcedTea and IcedTea-Web are, the many
improvements have gone in over the past year, and where the two projects are
headed over the next year.

In short:
* Want to know what IcedTea/IcedTea-Web are? Come to this talk!
* Wondering what we did over the past year? Come to this talk!
* Wondering where IcedTea/IcedTea-Web are headed? Come to this talk!
* Don't care about Java and want to fall asleep? Come to this talk!

Well maybe not the last one, but you will leave satisfied about #s 1, 2
and 3 :)</abstract>
